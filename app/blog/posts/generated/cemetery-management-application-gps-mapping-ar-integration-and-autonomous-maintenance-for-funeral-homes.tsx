  content: "# Cemetery Management Application: GPS Mapping, AR Integration, and Autonomous Maintenance for Funeral Homes\n\n## Overview\nThis post outlines plans for a custom SaaS application for Marshall Memorial Funeral Home, combining cemetery and funeral operations. It focuses on GPS-based grave mapping for navigation, AR for maintenance efficiency, and autonomous systems (drones, UGVs) for patrols and data collection. Tied to Revenant Hollow's AR ecosystem, it addresses discovery, MVP development, and advanced features like topography handling and task prioritization.\n\n## Background on Marshall Memorial\n- **Hybrid Operations**: Marshall Memorial in Albertville combines funeral home services with multiple cemeteries, a less common setup requiring specialized tools for both.\n- **Current Needs**: Apprenticeship insights reveal gaps in existing software; cemeteries and funeral homes have separate vendors, but no integrated SaaS handles contracts, obituaries, interment rights, and maintenance effectively.\n- **Discovery Process**: Initial discussions with staff (e.g., Courtney, my wife) highlight homework done on competitors—none fully integrate both sides. My tech background positions this as an opportunity for a tailored CRM with novel features.\n\n## Core Problems and Solutions\n- **Administrative Challenges**: Separate workflows for funeral (at-need services) and cemetery (plot sales, markers) lead to inefficient hacks or dismissals by vendors.\n- **Maintenance Pain Points**: Manual mowing, obstacle detection (e.g., uneven markers), fallen limbs, recent burials needing dirt, overgrown areas. Limited time amplifies prioritization needs.\n- **Public/Staff Tools**: Internal app for staff/contractors (work orders, routes); public-facing for grave navigation (find gardens, plots).\n- **Solution Framework**: Build a SaaS CRM with custom modules; leverage GPS for mapping, AR for on-site guidance, AI for prioritization based on visitor data, burial schedules, and change detection.\n\n## MVP Approach\n- **Starting Simple**: Focus on garden-level navigation—define boundaries via legal descriptions/tax maps, convert to latitude/longitude for precision.\n- **Data Collection**: Manual phone-based capture (lat/long/altitude) for baselines; app renders map showing user position, garden centers/boundaries, and directions.\n- **Iteration**: Add plot-level detail; address topography (curved terrain vs. straight-line coords) using non-Euclidean geometry if needed. Use legal descriptions as shortcuts for accuracy.\n\n## Advanced Features\n- **Drone/UGV Patrols**: Autonomous drones (aerial routes) or UGVs (ground tracks) for real-time image data; dock/charge independently. Compare to last state (like version control) to detect changes (fallen trees, vases, garbage, grass height).\n- **Threshold Alerts**: Set tolerances (e.g., grass height); generate work orders for issues. Track speed/efficiency for training (compare experienced vs. junior mowers).\n- **AR Integration**: Mixed-reality headsets (e.g., Oculus Quest passthrough) for mowing: flash red warnings for obstacles, arrows to uneven markers, voice/text descriptions (e.g., \"Slow down—uneven marker ahead\").\n- **Prioritization Engine**: Analyze data (visitor upticks, recent burials, terrain) to create routes/to-dos. Estimate efficiency gains (e.g., leveling markers reduces mowing time by X%).\n- **Autonomous Mowing**: Integrate off-shelf robo-mowers; use app data for paths/obstacle avoidance. Humans handle non-autonomous tasks; optimize over time.\n\n## Ties to Revenant Hollow\n- **Shared Tech Ecosystem**: Cemetery mapping aligns with Revenant Hollow's AR sports complexes—geolocating physical spaces for virtual overlays (e.g., gamified skating tricks, dance floor syncing).\n- **Privacy/Security Parallels**: Data collection (images, motion) mirrors AR privacy needs; solutions like edge-hashing could transfer.\n- **Broader Vision**: Cemetery as \"gateway\" into location-based AR; horror-themed Revenant Hollow benefits from grave-mapping tech for immersive experiences.\n\n## Suggestions on How This Content Might Be Useful to Others\n- **For Funeral Home Operators**: Provides a blueprint for integrated SaaS tools combining CRM, mapping, and automation, improving efficiency in hybrid operations.\n- **For Cemetery Managers**: Ideas for GPS/AR apps to streamline maintenance, prioritize tasks, and enhance visitor navigation, reducing manual labor.\n- **For AR/Drone Developers**: Concepts for topography-aware mapping and change-detection patrols, applicable to outdoor venues like parks or farms.\n- **For Startup Founders**: Demonstrates turning niche problems (e.g., uneven markers) into MVP features, with scalability to broader ecosystems like AR entertainment.\n- **For Tech Enthusiasts**: Inspiration for mechanical/AI hedges (e.g., electric robots, solar power) amid AI disruption, blending hands-on work with software.\n\n## Additional Information Validating Perspective\nMy plans for a cemetery management app with GPS mapping align with existing tools like Chronicle and Cemify, which offer GIS digitization and grave location features but lack full funeral home integration, as noted in Capterra's 2025 cemetery software reviews.

Lately, I've been talking about location-based experiences, mixed reality. This one's about the cemetery management application, related to my plans for Revenant Hollow and the augmented reality sports complex—all in the same technology space.\n\nMy wife is apprenticing at Marshall Memorial Funeral Home in Albertville, and they need website work. Most of what they need is digital marketing-related. They're a funeral home with several cemeteries—a hybrid. Usually, cemeteries are separate (city/church/public), but for-profit ones sell burials/markers. Few businesses combine both.\n\nThey need a SaaS product, as no vendor handles both well. Products exist for cemeteries or funeral homes, but integration lacks. Vendors downplay/dismiss the other side or suggest hacks. Features need nuance for each.\n\nApart from digital marketing (website, sales funnels, lead capture, social dashboards, SEO, blogging), the SaaS handles funeral/cemetery data. That's second nature—old-school skills, like a CRM with industry specifics.\n\nWhat caught my attention: Cemetery management with GPS-based grave tracking, plotting, virtual management, interment rights. Internal tool for staff/contractors; public app for navigation.\n\nIt's serendipitous—aligns with Revenant Hollow's location-based tech. Mapping geographical locations to virtual space is foundational.\n\nThis summer, I helped with cemetery maintenance—mowing, equipment repairs—to refresh mechanical skills as an AI hedge. Diversify beyond web dev; past mechanic experience with diesels/equipment.\n\nWhile mowing, thought: Use tech for maintenance. Plot markers for leveling (avoid dull blades/marker damage). My idea, now everyone wants it.\n\nStart with gardens (e.g., Christus, Last Supper)—boundaries/centers for navigation. MVP: App tells if you're in the right garden, directs you.\n\nData collection: Phone lat/long/altitude for baselines. Render map showing position/directions.\n\nIterate: Add plots; address topography (curved terrain vs. straight coords)—non-Euclidean geometry? Use legal descriptions as shortcuts.\n\nBring image data: Drones (aerial routes) or UGVs (ground tracks)—autonomous, dock/charge. Compare to last state (like version control) for changes (trees, vases, garbage, grass height).\n\nThreshold alerts: Tolerances for issues; generate work orders.\n\nAR integration: Headsets (Oculus passthrough) for mowing—red warnings/arrows for obstacles, descriptions (e.g., \"Uneven marker ahead\").\n\nPrioritization: Analyze visitor upticks, burials, terrain for routes/to-dos. Estimate gains (e.g., leveling markers reduces time X%).\n\nAutonomous mowing: Off-shelf robo-mowers use app data for paths/avoidance. Humans handle rest; optimize.\n\nUGVs for perspective like robo-mowers—important for terrain.\n\nFuture: Drill into marketing/CRM. Outlines core framework for cemetery maintenance app.",
