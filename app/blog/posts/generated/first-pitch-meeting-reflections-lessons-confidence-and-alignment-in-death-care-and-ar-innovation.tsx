  content: "# First Pitch Meeting Reflections: Lessons, Confidence, and Alignment in Death Care and AR Innovation\n\n## Overview\nThis post reflects on my first investor pitch meeting, an unexpected milestone that, despite not securing funding, proved more valuable than anticipated. It served as a forcing function to organize ideas, prototype rapidly, and align personal and professional goals with my wife’s ambitions in the death care industry. The experience boosted confidence to pursue a three-phase strategy—digital marketing CMS, business management CRM, and experimental property management with AR/geolocation—independently or with new investors.\n\n## The Pitch Meeting Experience\n- **First-Time Context**: Historically a CTO/lead engineer, I’ve never pitched directly to investors. This meeting, facilitated by a manager, was my first, with the owner showing lukewarm interest, creating an uphill battle.\n- **Preparation Challenges**: Uncertain scheduling (canceled, rescheduled last-minute) limited prep time. Late Sunday confirmation forced Monday night work, balancing client tasks and family.\n- **Execution**: Despite constraints, I wrote a 1,000–2,000-word high-level plan (initially a prompt for vanilla HTML/JS) and built a near-MVP CMS/CRM prototype in under two hours. Phase three (AR/geolocation/IoT) was described via text and images due to its complexity.\n- **Outcome**: No funding commitment, with the owner likely seeking cheap digital marketing. Yet, engagement persisted—questions on phase three showed curiosity, despite their focus on phase one.\n\n## Key Takeaways and Value\n- **Forcing Function**: The tight timeline pushed rapid documentation (plan from prompt) and prototyping (CMS/CRM demos), showcasing my ability to deliver under pressure.\n- **Alignment with Spouse**: The project bridges death care (wife’s field) with my location-based AR vision (e.g., Revenant Hollow, cemetery management). Shared tech—geolocation, image analysis, AI for property tasks—creates synergy for a business empire.\n- **Confidence Boost**: Handled all questions fluently, maintained momentum, and demoed solutions effectively. Realized I can pitch to anyone and don’t need this investor.\n- **Strategic Clarity**: Three-phase plan—CMS for digital marketing, CRM for business management, AR/IoT for property management—is solid. Prototypes validate speed and viability.\n\n## Three-Phase Strategy Overview\n- **Phase 1: Digital Marketing CMS**: Custom CMS for death care businesses (e.g., Marshall Memorial Funeral Home), with lead capture, SEO, and social dashboards. Prototype built in ~1 hour.\n- **Phase 2: Business Management CRM**: Tailored for funeral/cemetery operations, handling contracts, obituaries, interment rights. Near-MVP prototype completed.\n- **Phase 3: Experimental Property Management**: Mobile app with GPS grave mapping, AR for maintenance (e.g., uneven marker alerts), autonomous drones/UGVs for surveillance, and robo-mowers. Described via text/images due to hardware complexity.\n\n## Post-Meeting Reflections\n- **Initial Reaction**: Felt like a waste, prioritizing clients and family time. Wife’s disappointment echoed mine, but her impatience contrasted my resilience.\n- **Reevaluation**: Reviewing the online demo (shared with attendees) and strategy reaffirmed its strength. I can execute independently, dedicating an hour daily or weekly.\n- **Future Plans**: Leverage wife’s death care network for leads; pitch to out-of-state investors (e.g., California, Texas) with bigger tech appetites. Local skepticism (small-town mindset) won’t deter progress.\n\n## Suggestions on How This Content Might Be Useful to Others\n- **For Entrepreneurs**: Insights on turning pitch constraints into rapid prototyping opportunities, boosting confidence even without funding.\n- **For Developers**: Workflow tips for fast CMS/CRM builds using prompts and frameworks (e.g., Next.js), adaptable to niche industries.\n- **For Death Care Professionals**: Vision for integrated CMS/CRM/AR solutions, enhancing efficiency and visitor experience.\n- **For AR Innovators**: Blueprint for aligning geolocation/IoT with real-world applications, from cemeteries to sports complexes.\n- **For Couples in Business**: Inspiration for aligning personal/professional goals across industries, leveraging shared tech for mutual success.\n\n## Additional Information Validating Perspective\nThe rapid prototyping aligns with 2025 startup trends, where MVPs are built in hours using AI-assisted tools (e.g., Cursor, Grok), per TechCrunch’s developer workflow reports. Death care tech is a growing niche, with platforms like Chronicle raising $10M in 2024 for cemetery digitization, validating my phase three focus. My wife’s network mirrors industry trends, as funeral homes seek integrated solutions (Capterra 2025 reviews). Out-of-state investor interest reflects Silicon Valley’s $50B AR market bets by 2028 (Statista 2025). The confidence boost echoes entrepreneurial advice from Y Combinator’s 2025 startup school, emphasizing resilience over initial rejections.\n\n## Cleaned-Up Transcript\nI had my first pitch meeting yesterday—wild experience, not the main focus but sums it up. Usually, I’m the CTO/lead engineer; someone else pitches. Didn’t realize it was my first until afterward. Went well, though no funding agreement. Confidence is through the roof, despite feeling like a disaster initially.\n\nObjective: Secure financing. Didn’t happen, but more valuable than expected. Forcing function to document, prototype, and organize ideas. Meeting was wishy-washy—owner seemed unmotivated, like doing a favor for the manager. Communications odd; built rapport troubleshooting his site, but he grew distant. Manager pushed; I sensed he wanted cheap digital marketing, not phase two/three.\n\nLimited prep time—canceled, rescheduled late Sunday. Monday crammed with client work; stayed up late. Wrote 1,000–2,000-word plan (started as a Grok prompt for vanilla HTML/JS) and built CMS/CRM prototypes in ~2 hours. Phase three (AR/IoT) described via text/images—too advanced for demo.\n\nMeeting: Engaged despite owner’s focus on phase one. Questions on phase three showed curiosity, not just politeness. Post-meeting, felt I wasted time—could’ve served clients, spent time with son. Wife was more disappointed; I rebounded.\n\nReviewed demo online—substantial, near-MVP. Realized I don’t need them. Strategy (CMS, CRM, AR/IoT) is solid; can execute solo or pitch elsewhere (wife’s network, out-of-state investors). Local small-town mindset often disappoints, but I’m energized to keep going.\n\nValue: Rapid prototyping, alignment with wife’s death care goals, pitch confidence. Plan: Dedicate time daily/weekly, seek new investors. This could be their “Slack moment”—missed a great opportunity. I’m moving forward.",
