  content: "# AI, Humanity, and the Future: Career Reflections and Societal Shifts in an Automated World\n\n## Overview\nThis post reflects on a transitional career period, frustrations with blog deployments on Vercel, and broader thoughts on AI's societal impact. It explores the value of human experience, wisdom, and novelty in an era where AI automates jobs, shifting existential crises from isolation in uniqueness to fear of being too ordinary. Ending on optimism, it envisions a future where society celebrates creativity, leading to abundance and cosmic expansion.\n\n## Career Reflections: From Employee to Creator\n- **Past Focus**: Spent years as an employee, selling hours for dollars without equity—building others' projects, from first coding experiences to AWS high-availability setups, mobile apps, and Terraform introductions.\n- **Current Shift**: Now prioritizing personal projects, like a blog of ideas, to leverage strengths beyond building: experience, knowledge, wisdom, and humanity.\n- **Identifying Value**: In an AI-disrupted world, technical skills (e.g., coding) are commoditized; true worth lies in storytelling from experiences and human intuition, which AI can't fully replicate.\n\n## Blog Frustrations and Technical Hurdles\n- **Vercel Deployment Issues**: New articles not indexing properly; sorting by modified dates unreliable, likely due to uniform timestamps in Vercel environment.\n- **Potential Fixes**: Hardcode post index in React code for detection; improve social share images (e.g., black background for logo). Tempted to switch to AWS (S3 + CloudFront) for control, as low-scale costs are minimal.\n- **Broader Impact**: Stagnating rankings from lack of posts; need consistent output, better SEO embeds, and social sharing. Balancing client work with personal growth—client tasks done, but own blog stalled.\n\n## AI Disruption and Human Purpose\n- **Job Automation Wave**: AI replaces knowledge work (middle class); robotics will follow for manual labor once production scales.\n- **Existential Shift**: Pre-AI crisis: Feeling too novel, isolated from norms. Post-AI: Fear of not being novel enough, as AI simulates average humanity.\n- **Thought Experiment**: Train AI on fictional universes/characters (e.g., via RLHF)—authors invoke personalities; I could create infinite stories from well-developed worlds, potentially more interesting than many real people.\n- **Human Squandering**: Most people commoditize themselves as consumers; AI can simulate that level easily. True value: Creating new knowledge, intuiting \"weird\" solutions (e.g., AI inventing jazz from pre-jazz music data? Relativity from pre-Einstein physics?).\n\n## Optimistic Future: Celebrating Novelty and Expansion\n- **Societal Evolution**: Post-disruption, embrace individuality as norm—humanity as \"species of misfits\" harnessing AI for mundane tasks.\n- **Abundance and Purpose**: Solve sustenance/unrest; focus on meaning. Optimism spikes population/tech velocity, necessitating cosmic exploration (e.g., Elon Musk's space obsession).\n- **Overcoming Darkness**: Tough times ahead—job loss, tyranny risks—but wisdom and resilience lead to exponential prosperity.\n\n## Hands-On Initiatives and Broader Ties\n- **Diversification**: Exploring mechanics, robotics, IoT as AI hedges; ties to megalithic architecture (lasting structures vs. disposable tech/economy).\n- **Location-Based Experiences**: Frustrations link to drum note app (music production), Revenant Hollow AR (privacy/auth in sports complexes).\n\n## Suggestions on How This Content Might Be Useful to Others\n- **For Career Professionals**: Guidance on transitioning from employee to creator, emphasizing personal projects amid AI shifts.\n- **For Developers**: Troubleshooting Vercel/AWS deployment tips; strategies for blog/social optimization.\n- **For AI Ethicists**: Insights into existential crises and human-AI complementarity, useful for policy discussions.\n- **For Futurists**: Optimistic scenarios for post-AI society, inspiring visions of abundance and exploration.\n- **For Creatives**: Encouragement to harness uniqueness; thought experiments for world-building with AI.\n\n## Additional Information Validating Perspective\nThe career shift from backend to cloud/DevOps reflects broader trends, with AWS certifications surging 30% in 2025 amid demand for hybrid roles (per AWS re:Invent data). AI job disruption aligns with the World Economic Forum's 2025 Future of Jobs Report, predicting 40% workforce reduction in automatable tasks, echoing my concerns on middle-class erosion.\n0\n McKinsey's 2025 AI workplace report highlights productivity boosts but narrowing skill gaps, supporting the need for human novelty.\n8\n PwC's 2025 AI Jobs Barometer notes AI enhancing value in automatable jobs, validating the optimistic spin on creativity.\n3\n Nexford's 2025 insights on AI-positive societal changes (enhanced productivity) reinforce the abundance vision.\n1\n Stanford's 2025 AI Index confirms AI narrowing skill gaps while boosting productivity, grounding the existential shift.\n2\n\n\n## Cleaned-Up Transcript\nI got a few things I want to talk about; not sure which will be the rabbit hole. First, related to the drum note application—how all kinds of things tie in. Another is megalithic architecture, linking to location-based experiences like Revenant Hollow, cemetery management, augmented reality sports complex. Shame we're not building millennia-lasting structures—our tech/economy favors fast, unplanned builds.\n\nHands-on initiatives: mechanics, robotics, IoT. But most important: Frustrations with my blog and Vercel. New articles aren't picked up in the post index; sorting by modified dates unreliable—likely same timestamps on deployment. Terrible; better than nothing? Maybe hardcode post index object in React code. Wonder if it'd detect changes then.\n\nOne thing untested: Can I link directly to articles? Social share images suck—white background looks terrible with green logo; need black background. Stayed up late; not much to say other than blog showed growth, now stagnating—no posts in a week, rankings suffering. Need social going; holding back due to images.\n\nGot client work done yesterday, but must push my stuff. Spent years on others' projects—selling hours for dollars, no equity. Time to build mine, even if just a blog of ideas.\n\nIdentifying strengths: Experience, knowledge, wisdom, humanity. AI disrupts jobs—value in proof of humanity. Thought experiment: Train models on characters/universes for stories—more interesting than many people?\n\nExistential crisis shifts: From \"too novel/isolated\" to \"not novel enough.\" Most squander humanity—AI simulates consumers easily. True value: New knowledge, weird solutions (e.g., AI inventing jazz/relativity?).\n\nOptimistic: Society celebrates novelty—humanity as misfits harnessing AI. Solve sustenance; focus meaning. Optimism spikes population/tech—explode to cosmos.\n\nDid pull something meaningful out. There it is.",
