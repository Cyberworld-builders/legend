# Intro to Linux: How I stayed in the Dev Game while too Broke to buy a PC

## Overview
This post recounts my journey learning Linux, starting with my first exposure at DocWorks, an electronic medical records (EMR) startup, and evolving through necessity after being laid off. It details how Linux, specifically Ubuntu, became a critical part of my toolkit as a software developer and cloud architect, transforming an end-of-life Windows XP machine into a functional development workstation. This experience shaped my career, providing foundational skills in command-line operations, networking, and server management.

## Key Moments
### Initial Exposure at DocWorks
- **Introduction to Ubuntu**: At DocWorks (circa 2011–2013), a colleague with advanced networking certifications (including CCNA) introduced me to Ubuntu. Unlike my Windows-centric background, Ubuntu’s graphical interface (likely transitioning from Unity to GNOME) was approachable for a casual user, sparking my interest. This was my first meaningful encounter with Linux, beyond vague references in hacker culture or movies.
- **Context of Inexperience**: As a self-taught developer among formally educated colleagues, I lacked prior Linux exposure. The colleague’s mention of Ubuntu stuck with me, though he provided minimal guidance, often gatekeeping knowledge and leading me down unproductive paths.

### Necessity-Driven Adoption
- **Reviving an End-of-Life Machine**: After being fired from DocWorks, I faced a challenge with an aging Windows XP machine, rendered nearly unusable after Microsoft discontinued security updates (around 2012–2013). Unable to afford a new computer, I installed Ubuntu, which breathed new life into the hardware by eliminating Windows’ bloatware.
- **Learning Through Necessity**: Ubuntu’s lightweight nature and minimal default software forced me to learn essential Linux skills, including Bash command-line operations, file management, package management (using `apt`), and basic networking configuration. This extended the machine’s usability by three years, serving as my primary development workstation.

### Professional Impact
- **Career Catalyst**: Proficiency in Linux, gained through hands-on use of Ubuntu, became a key asset when I transitioned to contract work as a cable technician and later as a software developer. The ability to claim Linux experience opened doors to server-side development and cloud architecture roles.
- **Skill Development**: Familiarity with Linux commands, networking, and software configuration enhanced my capabilities as a full-stack developer. This experience was critical in enterprise settings, where Linux servers are prevalent, and it aligned with my later work on cloud-based projects.

## Challenges and Reflections
- **Workplace Dynamics at DocWorks**: My departure from DocWorks was partly due to a lack of confidence in asserting my abilities over a colleague who, despite advanced credentials, was a poor teacher and gatekeeper. This experience taught me the importance of self-advocacy in competitive tech environments, a lesson learned after being pitted against a colleague with a master’s degree.
- **Gatekeeping in Small-Town Tech**: In a small town with limited tech opportunities, I encountered resource guarding and gatekeeping, akin to behaviors I later observed in other trades like mechanics. This highlighted the scarcity-driven competition in non-tech hubs, contrasting with the collaborative environments I later experienced in enterprise settings.
- **Blessing in Disguise**: Being fired from DocWorks was ultimately beneficial, preventing me from becoming entrenched in a dysfunctional startup with poor coding practices. It pushed me toward diverse experiences, including cable installation, which honed customer service and problem-solving skills that complemented my technical growth.

## Validation of Perspective and Authority
My Linux journey began at DocWorks, where I was exposed to Ubuntu, and continued through self-directed learning on an end-of-life Windows XP machine. With over a decade of experience as a software engineer, including roles in full-stack development and cloud architecture, I’ve applied Linux skills across enterprise environments, managing servers and developing compliant systems under HIPAA regulations (as noted at DocWorks). My prior posts detail my early web development with Flash and PHP, and my work on innovative projects like Revenant Hollow, which integrates IoT and AR, further leveraging Linux-based systems. The transition from Windows to Ubuntu mirrors broader industry shifts, such as the post-XP era and the rise of Linux in development and cloud computing. My experience navigating gatekeeping and small-town tech dynamics provides a unique perspective on building resilience and skills in challenging environments, establishing credibility in software development and system administration.

## Cleaned Transcript
This is about how I learned Linux, my journey getting hands-on experience, becoming comfortable with it, and making it a core part of my toolkit as a professional and computer user. My earliest exposure to Linux was at DocWorks, my first full-time development job. The other developers there had computer science degrees, certifications, and formal training, while I was self-taught. One colleague, deeply into hacker culture with a CCNA certification and experience in local computer shops, introduced me to Ubuntu. He mentioned it and showed me its graphical interface, likely during the transition from Unity to GNOME. It was the first time I saw Linux as something a casual user could install and use. I was a Windows guy, too broke for a Mac, and this was my first real encounter with Linux beyond vague mentions in movies or hacker culture.

I didn’t learn much from him—he was unhelpful, gatekeeping information and leading me down rabbit holes. Fast forward a year or two, I was fired from DocWorks, a bad decision on both sides. I was pitted against this colleague, Justin, and asked if I could take over his role. I didn’t feel confident enough to claim I could, not wanting to throw him under the bus. In retrospect, I should have asserted myself, as it was about confidence, not evidence. He was finishing a master’s degree and seemed poised for job offers, but his abrasive personality and poor teaching—bragging about students failing his classes—made him ineffective. Teaching is a skill, and he lacked it, withholding knowledge and setting me up to waste time.

Getting fired was a blessing. I avoided entrenching bad habits from DocWorks’ dysfunctional “Franken system.” I moved to contract work as a cable technician, installing modems and setting up internet. This taught me customer service, effort estimation, and how to translate technical solutions into customer-friendly terms, skills that complemented my tech growth. At DocWorks, I gained valuable experience with databases, servers, APIs, and HIPAA compliance, despite picking up bad coding habits. Leaving early prevented me from becoming a “lifer” stuck in a poorly architected startup.

My real Linux breakthrough came post-DocWorks. I had an old Windows XP machine, end-of-life after Microsoft stopped security updates around 2012–2013. It was nearly unusable, crashing constantly due to bloatware. Unable to afford a new computer, I installed Ubuntu, which revived the machine. Linux’s lightweight nature, with minimal default software, freed up resources, giving the computer three more years of life. Using Ubuntu as my primary workstation forced me to learn Bash, command-line operations, file management, package management with `apt`, and networking. This hands-on experience was like magic, transforming a dead machine into a functional development environment.

This Linux proficiency shaped my career. When I started contract development work, I could claim Linux experience, leading to roles managing servers and pursuing cloud architecture. The necessity of using Ubuntu directed my path as a full-stack developer and cloud architect, making Linux a cornerstone of my professional toolkit.
