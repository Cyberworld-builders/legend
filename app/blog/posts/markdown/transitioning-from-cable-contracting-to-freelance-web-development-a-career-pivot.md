# Transitioning from Cable Contracting to Freelance Web Development: A Career Pivot

## Overview
This post details my transition from over three years as a cable installation contractor to becoming a full-time freelance web developer, a pivotal moment in my career. It highlights the challenges of a misclassified contractor role, the rediscovery of my programming skills, and the breakthrough moment when I leveraged Upwork to escape manual labor and build a sustainable tech career. This journey underscores the power of self-directed learning, resilience, and the opportunities of the global freelance market.

## Key Moments
### The Cable Contracting Experience
- **Misclassification Challenges**: For over three years (circa 2012–2015), I worked as a contractor for Charter Communications (now Spectrum) through a subcontractor, Southern Cable. The role blurred lines between employee and contractor, leading to a class action lawsuit for misclassification. We were treated as employees (e.g., controlled schedules, assigned jobs, and rigid standards) but classified as contractors, bearing payroll taxes, equipment costs, and job volatility without benefits like guaranteed hours.
- **Punitive Practices**: Contractors faced penalties for seeking work elsewhere, such as receiving bad jobs or equipment chargebacks. One incident involved falsely attributing a colleague’s lost equipment to me as punishment for applying to a satellite company, highlighting the lack of autonomy.
- **Financial Instability**: Jobs often paid poorly (e.g., $20 for 4–5 hours of work to meet technical quality assurance standards), with chargebacks for failing inspections. Slow periods could mean earning $20/day, with no freedom to seek alternative work, pushing me to find a way out.

### Rediscovering Programming
- **Reviving Skills with Ubuntu**: As cable work deteriorated, I revived an end-of-life Windows XP machine with Ubuntu (as detailed in a prior post), equipping it with PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL tools. This allowed me to maintain my programming skills, initially without a clear monetization plan.
- **Learning WordPress**: Inspired by my DocWorks experience with PHP and MySQL, I explored WordPress, a PHP-based platform gaining traction. I spent an hour daily after exhausting 16-hour cable shifts, often falling asleep at the keyboard, to sharpen my skills and experiment with web development.

### Breakthrough with Upwork
- **Discovering Upwork**: In 2015, I found Upwork, noticing a demand for WordPress and PHP expertise. My first job was a $20 fixed-price project customizing a WordPress plugin, requiring significant JavaScript work. Despite the low hourly rate after a month’s effort, it was true contract work with negotiation freedom, unlike cable contracting.
- **First Payment Milestone**: The client, Chris Bailey, paid the $20 plus a $20 bonus, requesting more work. Completing subsequent tasks in days rather than weeks, I earned $100, validating the potential of freelancing. This moment, when the money hit my bank account, was a game-changer, convincing my wife and me of a viable path forward.
- **Going Full-Time**: In May 2015 (or 2016), Southern Cable lost its contract, forcing a decision between another low-paying plant job or freelancing. I lined up $1,000 in fixed-price Upwork jobs, dug a trench to run a data cable to our barn for a quiet workspace, and coded relentlessly for a week. Earning $1,000 confirmed freelancing’s viability, marking my exit from cable work.

### Technical Context and Choices
- **Monolithic PHP Approach**: Influenced by DocWorks’ PHP-centric environment and a colleague’s preference for monolithic architectures, I initially avoided frameworks and microservices. My negative experience with a hacky Ruby on Rails setup (using Cygwin and Pound on Windows servers) soured me on MVC patterns, though I later recognized their value.
- **WordPress as an Entry Point**: WordPress’s PHP foundation aligned with my skills, enabling quick wins in plugin customization. This focus leveraged my DocWorks experience with compliance-driven systems (e.g., HL7, SOAP/XML APIs) while adapting to a modern platform.

## Key Takeaways
- **True Contracting Freedom**: Unlike cable work’s restrictive “contracting,” Upwork offered real autonomy to negotiate scope, price, or decline jobs without repercussions, empowering me to control my career.
- **Resilience and Self-Directed Learning**: Exhausting cable shifts didn’t stop me from coding after hours, demonstrating the importance of persistence in skill development and career transitions.
- **Reputation and Opportunity**: The global freelance market rewarded skills and results over credentials, with platforms like Upwork amplifying opportunities through reputation-building.

## Validation of Perspective and Authority
My transition from cable contracting to freelance web development in 2015 marks a decade-plus career in software engineering, building on my DocWorks experience (2011–2013) with PHP, MySQL, and Linux, as detailed in prior posts. My success on Upwork, starting with a $20 job and scaling to $1,000 in a week, reflects my ability to deliver value in a competitive global market. The cable misclassification issues align with documented lawsuits against Charter/Spectrum (e.g., a 2016 class action settlement for contractor misclassification), validating my experience. My choice of WordPress and PHP leverages my DocWorks skills, while my later work on projects like Revenant Hollow demonstrates growth into modern technologies like AR and IoT. This journey, grounded in persistence and strategic platform use, establishes my credibility as a self-taught developer and advocate for freelancing as a career path.

## Cleaned Transcript
This is about how I transitioned from cable contracting to freelance web development, a major turning point in my career and life. Previously, I discussed moving from a plant worker to a tech job at DocWorks and briefly mentioned shifting to cable contracting after losing that job. Here, I focus on leaving cable work for freelancing.

For over three years (circa 2012–2015), I worked as a cable installation contractor for Charter Communications (now Spectrum) through Southern Cable. The role blurred employee and contractor lines, leading to a class action lawsuit for misclassification. We were treated like employees—controlled schedules, assigned jobs, rigid standards—but classified as contractors, responsible for payroll taxes, equipment, and volatile income. Penalties for seeking other work, like chargebacks for “lost” equipment, were common. One incident saw a colleague’s equipment losses falsely attributed to me after I applied to a satellite company. Jobs often paid $20 for 4–5 hours of work to meet technical quality assurance (TQA) standards, with chargebacks for failures, making earnings as low as $20/day during slow periods.

As cable work worsened, I revived my programming skills using an Ubuntu-loaded Windows XP machine. After 16-hour cable shifts, I coded for an hour nightly, often falling asleep at the keyboard, to stay sharp without a monetization plan. I explored WordPress, a PHP-based platform aligning with my DocWorks experience in PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL. My DocWorks background, focused on monolithic PHP and SOAP/XML APIs for compliance (e.g., HL7), shaped my initial avoidance of MVC frameworks, influenced by a poorly implemented Ruby on Rails system.

In 2015, I discovered Upwork, where WordPress and PHP jobs were in demand. My first $20 fixed-price job involved customizing a WordPress plugin, requiring significant JavaScript. Despite a low hourly rate after a month’s work, it was true contract work with negotiation freedom. The client, Chris Bailey, paid $20 plus a $20 bonus, requesting more work, which I completed in days, earning $100. This validated freelancing’s potential. On May 9, 2015 (or 2016), Southern Cable lost its contract, forcing a choice between another low-paying plant job or freelancing. I lined up $1,000 in Upwork jobs, ran a data cable to our barn for a quiet workspace, and coded for a week, earning $1,000. This confirmed I could go full-time, leaving cable behind.

Freelancing offered autonomy to negotiate or decline jobs, unlike cable work’s restrictions. The global market valued skills over credentials, and my persistence in learning WordPress after grueling shifts paved the way. Every time it rains, I’m grateful to work indoors, and I’ve learned to manage unreasonable clients by prioritizing reason and moving on when needed.
