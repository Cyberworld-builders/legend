# Example Post with Frontmatter

This is an example blog post that demonstrates how to use the new metadata system with YAML frontmatter.

## Overview

The new metadata system provides better control over blog post information, including:

- **Post dates**: Published, modified, and last reviewed dates
- **SEO metadata**: Title, description, keywords, and canonical URLs
- **Content categorization**: Topics, tags, series, and categories
- **Visual assets**: Header images and social sharing images
- **Publishing control**: Draft status, featured posts, and priority

## Benefits

1. **Better SEO**: Proper metadata for search engines
2. **Content organization**: Structured categorization and tagging
3. **Maintenance tracking**: Clear dates for content review
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to extend with new metadata fields

## Usage

Simply add YAML frontmatter to the top of your markdown files, and the system will automatically parse and use this metadata throughout the blog.

For more information, see the [frontmatter example documentation](/docs/frontmatter-example.md).
