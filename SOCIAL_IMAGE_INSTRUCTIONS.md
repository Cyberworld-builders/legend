# Social Media Image Creation Instructions

## Option 1: Using the HTML Template
1. Open public/social-card.html in a browser
2. Take a screenshot at 1200x630 resolution
3. Save as public/images/social-card.png

## Option 2: Using Online Tools
1. Use tools like Canva, Figma, or similar
2. Create a 1200x630 image with:
   - Black background (#000000)
   - Green text (#00ff00)
   - "CyberWorld Builders" as main title
   - "Software Engineering & Consulting Services" as subtitle
   - "cyberworldbuilders.com" as URL
3. Save as public/images/social-card.png

## Option 3: Using the Existing Logo
The current setup uses public/images/logo.png as the fallback social image.
This works but may not be optimized for social media previews.

## Current Social Image URLs:
- Default: https://cyberworldbuilders.com/images/logo.png
- Custom: https://cyberworldbuilders.com/images/social-card.png (when created)
