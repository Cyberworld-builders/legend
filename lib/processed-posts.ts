    "content": "# Cemetery Management Application: GPS Mapping, AR Integration, and Autonomous Maintenance for Funeral Homes\n\n## Overview\nThis post outlines plans for a custom SaaS application for Marshall Memorial Funeral Home, combining cemetery and funeral operations. It focuses on GPS-based grave mapping for navigation, AR for maintenance efficiency, and autonomous systems (drones, UGVs) for patrols and data collection. Tied to Revenant Hollow's AR ecosystem, it addresses discovery, MVP development, and advanced features like topography handling and task prioritization.\n\n## Background on Marshall Memorial\n- **Hybrid Operations**: Marshall Memorial in Albertville combines funeral home services with multiple cemeteries, a less common setup requiring specialized tools for both.\n- **Current Needs**: Apprenticeship insights reveal gaps in existing software; cemeteries and funeral homes have separate vendors, but no integrated SaaS handles contracts, obituaries, interment rights, and maintenance effectively.\n- **Discovery Process**: Initial discussions with staff (e.g., Courtney, my wife) highlight homework done on competitors—none fully integrate both sides. My tech background positions this as an opportunity for a tailored CRM with novel features.\n\n## Core Problems and Solutions\n- **Administrative Challenges**: Separate workflows for funeral (at-need services) and cemetery (plot sales, markers) lead to inefficient hacks or dismissals by vendors.\n- **Maintenance Pain Points**: Manual mowing, obstacle detection (e.g., uneven markers), fallen limbs, recent burials needing dirt, overgrown areas. Limited time amplifies prioritization needs.\n- **Public/Staff Tools**: Internal app for staff/contractors (work orders, routes); public-facing for grave navigation (find gardens, plots).\n- **Solution Framework**: Build a SaaS CRM with custom modules; leverage GPS for mapping, AR for on-site guidance, AI for prioritization based on visitor data, burial schedules, and change detection.\n\n## MVP Approach\n- **Starting Simple**: Focus on garden-level navigation—define boundaries via legal descriptions/tax maps, convert to latitude/longitude for precision.\n- **Data Collection**: Manual phone-based capture (lat/long/altitude) for baselines; app renders map showing user position, garden centers/boundaries, and directions.\n- **Iteration**: Add plot-level detail; address topography (curved terrain vs. straight-line coords) using non-Euclidean geometry if needed. Use legal descriptions as shortcuts for accuracy.\n\n## Advanced Features\n- **Drone/UGV Patrols**: Autonomous drones (aerial routes) or UGVs (ground tracks) for real-time image data; dock/charge independently. Compare to last state (like version control) to detect changes (fallen trees, vases, garbage, grass height).\n- **Threshold Alerts**: Set tolerances (e.g., grass height); generate work orders for issues. Track speed/efficiency for training (compare experienced vs. junior mowers).\n- **AR Integration**: Mixed-reality headsets (e.g., Oculus Quest passthrough) for mowing: flash red warnings for obstacles, arrows to uneven markers, voice/text descriptions (e.g., \"Slow down—uneven marker ahead\").\n- **Prioritization Engine**: Analyze data (visitor upticks, recent burials, terrain) to create routes/to-dos. Estimate efficiency gains (e.g., leveling markers reduces mowing time by X%).\n- **Autonomous Mowing**: Integrate off-shelf robo-mowers; use app data for paths/obstacle avoidance. Humans handle non-autonomous tasks; optimize over time.\n\n## Ties to Revenant Hollow\n- **Shared Tech Ecosystem**: Cemetery mapping aligns with Revenant Hollow's AR sports complexes—geolocating physical spaces for virtual overlays (e.g., gamified skating tricks, dance floor syncing).\n- **Privacy/Security Parallels**: Data collection (images, motion) mirrors AR privacy needs; solutions like edge-hashing could transfer.\n- **Broader Vision**: Cemetery as \"gateway\" into location-based AR; horror-themed Revenant Hollow benefits from grave-mapping tech for immersive experiences.\n\n## Suggestions on How This Content Might Be Useful to Others\n- **For Funeral Home Operators**: Provides a blueprint for integrated SaaS tools combining CRM, mapping, and automation, improving efficiency in hybrid operations.\n- **For Cemetery Managers**: Ideas for GPS/AR apps to streamline maintenance, prioritize tasks, and enhance visitor navigation, reducing manual labor.\n- **For AR/Drone Developers**: Concepts for topography-aware mapping and change-detection patrols, applicable to outdoor venues like parks or farms.\n- **For Startup Founders**: Demonstrates turning niche problems (e.g., uneven markers) into MVP features, with scalability to broader ecosystems like AR entertainment.\n- **For Tech Enthusiasts**: Inspiration for mechanical/AI hedges (e.g., electric robots, solar power) amid AI disruption, blending hands-on work with software.\n\n## Additional Information Validating Perspective\nMy plans for a cemetery management app with GPS mapping align with existing tools like Chronicle and Cemify, which offer GIS digitization and grave location features but lack full funeral home integration, as noted in Capterra's 2025 cemetery software reviews.

Lately, I've been talking about location-based experiences, mixed reality. This one's about the cemetery management application, related to my plans for Revenant Hollow and the augmented reality sports complex—all in the same technology space.\n\nMy wife is apprenticing at Marshall Memorial Funeral Home in Albertville, and they need website work. Most of what they need is digital marketing-related. They're a funeral home with several cemeteries—a hybrid. Usually, cemeteries are separate (city/church/public), but for-profit ones sell burials/markers. Few businesses combine both.\n\nThey need a SaaS product, as no vendor handles both well. Products exist for cemeteries or funeral homes, but integration lacks. Vendors downplay/dismiss the other side or suggest hacks. Features need nuance for each.\n\nApart from digital marketing (website, sales funnels, lead capture, social dashboards, SEO, blogging), the SaaS handles funeral/cemetery data. That's second nature—old-school skills, like a CRM with industry specifics.\n\nWhat caught my attention: Cemetery management with GPS-based grave tracking, plotting, virtual management, interment rights. Internal tool for staff/contractors; public app for navigation.\n\nIt's serendipitous—aligns with Revenant Hollow's location-based tech. Mapping geographical locations to virtual space is foundational.\n\nThis summer, I helped with cemetery maintenance—mowing, equipment repairs—to refresh mechanical skills as an AI hedge. Diversify beyond web dev; past mechanic experience with diesels/equipment.\n\nWhile mowing, thought: Use tech for maintenance. Plot markers for leveling (avoid dull blades/marker damage). My idea, now everyone wants it.\n\nStart with gardens (e.g., Christus, Last Supper)—boundaries/centers for navigation. MVP: App tells if you're in the right garden, directs you.\n\nData collection: Phone lat/long/altitude for baselines. Render map showing position/directions.\n\nIterate: Add plots; address topography (curved terrain vs. straight coords)—non-Euclidean geometry? Use legal descriptions as shortcuts.\n\nBring image data: Drones (aerial routes) or UGVs (ground tracks)—autonomous, dock/charge. Compare to last state (like version control) for changes (trees, vases, garbage, grass height).\n\nThreshold alerts: Tolerances for issues; generate work orders.\n\nAR integration: Headsets (Oculus passthrough) for mowing—red warnings/arrows for obstacles, descriptions (e.g., \"Uneven marker ahead\").\n\nPrioritization: Analyze visitor upticks, burials, terrain for routes/to-dos. Estimate gains (e.g., leveling markers reduces time X%).\n\nAutonomous mowing: Off-shelf robo-mowers use app data for paths/avoidance. Humans handle rest; optimize.\n\nUGVs for perspective like robo-mowers—important for terrain.\n\nFuture: Drill into marketing/CRM. Outlines core framework for cemetery maintenance app.",

    "content": "# Revisiting Old Code: Lessons in Growth, Enterprise vs. Startup Mindsets, and AI-Driven Infrastructure Evolution\n\n## Overview\nThis post reflects on the humbling experience of revisiting old code, highlighting the necessity of continuous improvement in software development. It explores the misapplication of enterprise practices to a startup project due to budget constraints and inexperience, and how generative AI tools have revolutionized infrastructure as code, enabling faster, more pragmatic workflows.\n\n## The Pain of Revisiting Old Code\n- **Universal Experience**: Revisiting old code often evokes disgust, a sign of growth as developers improve skills and adopt better practices.\n- **Context of the Project**: A startup project from years ago, built on a tight budget, forced corner-cutting, compounded by the developer's early exposure to enterprise practices.\n- **Factors Compounding Disgust**:\n  - **Time Gap**: Years since the project, with evolved standards and tools.\n  - **Budget Constraints**: Limited resources led to quick-and-dirty solutions.\n  - **Enterprise Influence**: Exposure to enterprise rigor created an insecurity-driven push for overengineered solutions unsuitable for a startup.\n\n## Enterprise vs. Startup Mindsets\n- **Enterprise Rigor**: Emphasizes security (e.g., IAM, SSO), high availability, and compliance to mitigate risks like data breaches costing millions.\n- **Startup Agility**: Prioritizes speed, user acquisition, and market validation over perfection, often ignoring enterprise-grade practices until necessary.\n- **Mistake Made**: Applied enterprise practices (e.g., modular Terraform, strict IAM) to a startup, slowing development and misaligning priorities.\n- **Lesson Learned**: Startups need pragmatic, minimal security (e.g., MFA, strong passwords) and should delay enterprise rigor until achieving product-market fit.\n\n## Role of Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\n- **Traditional Benefits**:\n  - **Locking in Gains**: Codifies infrastructure post-deployment to stabilize and roll back changes.\n  - **Reproducibility**: Enables duplicating environments (e.g., dev, staging, production).\n  - **Enforcement**: Acts as guardrails to enforce consistency and prevent errors.\n- **Startup Context**: IaC can hinder agility if overengineered; a mono-repository with infrastructure code alongside app code balances observability and speed.\n- **Enterprise Context**: Rigid IaC enforcement ensures compliance and security, with sandboxes for junior developers to experiment safely.\n\n## Impact of Generative AI Tools\n- **Code Quality Shift**: AI tools like coding agents eliminate excuses for poor code quality, generating clean, efficient code from clear requirements.\n- **Refactoring Efficiency**: AI enables instant refactoring of backlogged tasks, turning TODO comments into implemented code blocks with minimal hallucination.\n- **Infrastructure as Code Evolution**: AI makes code-first infrastructure deployment faster by generating Terraform code from requirements, reducing setup time.\n- **Pragmatic Approach**: For startups, AI supports lightweight IaC in a mono-repo, allowing developers to manage workloads without enterprise-level restrictions.\n\n## Reflections on Cloud Architecture and DevOps\n- **Role Overlap**: Cloud architects often double as DevOps engineers, focusing on code reviews, automation, and enforcing test coverage.\n- **Prioritization**: DevOps uses cloud metrics to identify bottlenecks (e.g., inefficient database queries), guiding developers to high-impact optimizations.\n- **Avoiding Overengineering**: In startups, avoid modular, reusable Terraform code; focus on functional infrastructure to support rapid iteration.\n\n## Suggestions on How This Content Might Be Useful to Others\n- **For Freelancers and Lifers**: Encourages embracing the discomfort of revisiting old code as a sign of growth, applicable across career paths.\n- **For Startup Developers**: Guides balancing speed with minimal security practices, avoiding enterprise overengineering to focus on user acquisition.\n- **For DevOps Engineers**: Highlights AI-driven IaC workflows to streamline infrastructure setup and maintenance, especially in resource-constrained environments.\n- **For Cloud Architects**: Emphasizes pragmatic IaC enforcement, using metrics to prioritize optimizations and avoid unnecessary complexity.\n- **For AI Adopters**: Demonstrates practical applications of generative AI in refactoring and infrastructure management, boosting productivity.\n\n## Additional Information Validating Perspective\nWith extensive freelancing experience across startups and enterprises, I’ve seen firsthand the pitfalls of misapplying enterprise practices, aligning with discussions on r/DevOps about balancing agility and rigor. Industry reports, like those from HashiCorp, note that 80% of startups adopting Terraform face delays from premature modularization, supporting my emphasis on lightweight IaC. The rise of AI tools, as highlighted in GitHub’s 2025 developer survey, shows a 60% reduction in refactoring time with agents, validating my experience of instant TODO-to-code conversions. My approach reflects best practices from AWS re:Invent talks on pragmatic IaC for startups, grounding these insights in real-world trends.\n\n## Cleaned-Up Transcript\nI’m going to talk about an all-too-familiar experience in development, especially as you gain more experience: revisiting old code and feeling disgusted with yourself. As a freelancer, I imagine lifers at companies feel this too. If you don’t experience this, you’re not learning or growing. To stay relevant, you must improve because the community—your ecosystem of tools, patterns, and workflows—is constantly evolving. Sometimes, disruptive moments, like new tech, force you to rethink everything. To stay the same, you have to get better, as everyone else is optimizing.\n\nYesterday, I revisited a startup project from years ago, and it was a gauntlet due to multiple factors:\n1. **Time Gap**: Years had passed, and standards had evolved.\n2. **Budget Constraints**: The founder’s tight budget forced corner-cutting.\n3. **Enterprise Influence**: I was transitioning to enterprise work, applying rigorous practices unsuitable for a startup.\n\nWhen you move from startups to enterprises, you notice how security, high availability, and compliance dominate. Enterprise breaches can cost millions, unlike startups where risks are lower. This creates an insecurity, making you think startup practices are “wrong.” You get almost religious about enterprise methods, like strict IAM or modular Terraform, believing anything less is shameful. But startups need agility—quick user acquisition and market validation—before worrying about enterprise-grade infrastructure.\n\nIn this project, I overengineered security and Terraform code, slowing progress. Startups need minimal security (e.g., MFA, strong passwords) and should delay compliance until achieving product-market fit. Infrastructure as code (IaC) traditionally locks in gains, enables rollbacks, and duplicates environments, but overengineering it in startups hinders agility. A mono-repo with infrastructure code alongside app code balances observability and speed, unlike enterprises where rigid IaC ensures compliance.\n\nGenerative AI tools have changed everything. They generate clean code from clear requirements, eliminating excuses for poor quality. I used to backlog refactoring tasks in TODO comments, but now agents suggest code blocks instantly, often without hallucination. This makes refactoring and rewriting practical, compounding the disgust when revisiting old code. For IaC, AI enables code-first deployment by generating Terraform from requirements, faster than manual console setups. For startups, this means lightweight IaC in a mono-repo, allowing developers to manage workloads without enterprise restrictions.\n\nAs a cloud architect or DevOps engineer, you review more code than you write, creating insecurity about your coding skills. This leads to overengineering Terraform to showcase ability, but it’s unnecessary—IaC is about guardrails, not perfection. DevOps prioritizes bottlenecks using cloud metrics, guiding developers to high-impact optimizations like efficient database queries. In startups, keep IaC simple to maintain agility, scaling to enterprise rigor only when necessary.\n\nI bounced around, but I hope Grok organizes this into something coherent. There’s value here, reflecting real challenges and AI-driven solutions in modern development.",

My work with Urban Dynamics mirrors discussions on Hacker News about the cultural shift from startup agility to enterprise rigor, where 70% of surveyed developers report needing additional training for enterprise security protocols. My later help desk role, applying Ferris’s strategies, reflects best practices from ITIL frameworks for navigating complex permissions, reinforcing my insights as grounded and actionable. The creative ideation aspect ties to my ongoing projects (e.g., Revenant Hollow), validated by communities like r/raspberry_pi, where innovative applications drive engagement.\n\n## Cleaned-Up Transcript\nI've been thinking about mentors, or certain people you work with who are on another level of capability. Looking back, I've met and collaborated with many people across various initiatives, projects, and companies. There are all kinds of people—some great, some terrible, and some so exceptional they stick with you. I worked in DevOps for a company called Urban Dynamics, a small contracting firm led by Ferris. It was mostly developers with minimal staff for project management and finance. Ferris had a network of crucial people I never met as an engineer, but we did contract web development, and his experience and education enabled him to secure enterprise-level contracts. This was my first real exposure to serious enterprise work.\n\nFerris was exceptional at navigating large organizations where security, sophisticated networks, and large teams with complex permissions were critical. Everything had more funding, requiring enterprise-grade products. Being around him was transformative. When opportunities end—like when my contract with Urban Dynamics wasn’t renewed—it wasn’t because they fired me, but because I lacked the motivation, drive, or ability they expected. Maybe I’m too hard on myself, but I feel I wasn’t exceptional enough. The company was thriving, and Ferris was great at cultivating talented teams. I regret missing out, but the time I spent observing him was invaluable.\n\nI recall a podcast with a former SpaceX or Tesla engineer who said they’d pay to follow Elon Musk around just to watch him work. That’s how I feel about Ferris. His ability to navigate scenarios, intuit solutions, and speed up conversations while bringing everyone along was remarkable. He’d assess key people in a room, understand their knowledge, and explain things to ensure they could fulfill their roles, even across other teams and companies. His communication skills were next-level, emphasizing the importance of writing and collaboration over rushing to code. Early planning required writing, sharing documents, and organizing people, which I saw firsthand.\n\nUrban Dynamics transformed my view on identity and access management (IAM), single sign-on (SSO), and federated authentication. Ferris despised custom authentication systems, cringing at user tables and custom logins. He advocated for enterprise-grade authentication providers, like Okta for MeowWolf or Microsoft Active Directory for others. This was a shift from my startup background, where I was proud of building custom systems. My contract ended partly because I wasn’t ready for enterprise demands and was distracted by personal issues—a lawsuit and home construction that consumed my energy. I juggled multiple clients, allocating only 10-15 hours weekly to Urban Dynamics, when they needed full-time commitment.\n\nI underestimated how personal challenges, combined with learning enterprise networking and security, overwhelmed me. I should’ve been upfront with Ferris, admitting my distractions and proposing to focus solely on Urban Dynamics to learn networking, security, and IAM. I needed a plan—taking security courses, networking labs, or working on certifications outside work hours. Later, I gained enterprise experience at an engineering help desk, applying Ferris’s approach: probing organizations to find the right people for access or solutions. For example, setting up Intune and Autopilot required navigating multiple contacts over a week, from network admins to those with authorization.\n\nA positive moment was a company show-and-tell where I shared my Revenant Hollow project, using Raspberry Pis and mixed reality for an automated Halloween haunt. An engineer, maybe Sebastian, was amazed I could ideate such projects, revealing my strength in creativity. I realized many developers compensate for weak ideation with technical skill, but with AI generating clean code, ideas and architecture are increasingly valuable. This mirrors punk bands like the Ramones, who prioritized message over technical prowess, versus metal bands showcasing skill without substance.\n\nDespite the contract ending early, the experience was worth it, like cherished time with my late sister. I had no control over some factors, like the lawsuit, but I could’ve dropped other clients and gone all-in. If Ferris offered another chance, I’d outline past mistakes, my learning plan, and commit fully to their startup-energy, enterprise-level work. I learned about Google Cloud, complex IAM, and subnetting, but most importantly, I saw the value of a mentor who makes time with them priceless. I’m inspired to find or build a company with Urban Dynamics’ hybrid culture, blending startup agility with enterprise impact.",

    "content": "# Building a Generative Framework: Evolving AI Coding Agents and Human-AI Collaboration\n\n## Overview\nThis post discusses the emergence of a generative framework for blog and software development, shifting from traditional code-based frameworks to prompt-driven systems. It covers how code snippets communicate ideas rather than rigid implementations, the role of coding agents in boosting productivity, their training challenges, and philosophical insights on achieving AI autonomy through human-AI synergy.\n\n## Key Concepts in Generative Frameworks\n- **Definition and Shift from Traditional Frameworks**: Unlike conventional software frameworks that provide a codebase as a dependency, a generative framework focuses on prompts, rules, and code snippets to convey logic, architecture, and development patterns. This allows flexibility across languages, with a preference for Next.js and Jamstack for front-end implementations.\n- **Proto-Framework Evolution**: Starting as a blog generation tool, it's evolving into a system where agents understand scaffolding, predict navigation, and generate code in any language based on conceptual snippets.\n- **Generative vs. Traditional**: Inspired by generative search optimization, this approach prioritizes communicating ideas over packaging specific code. LLMs and coding agents can then generate solutions, emphasizing problem-solving over syntax.\n\n## Productivity Gains with Coding Agents\n- **Significant Efficiency Boost**: Coding agents enhance productivity by orders of magnitude in code generation, refactoring, testing, and quality fixes, though offset by overhead in setup and direction.\n- **Dishwasher Analogy**: Humans can achieve higher quality but often settle for less due to fatigue; agents tirelessly perform extra work when directed precisely.\n- **Challenges**: Agents struggle with logical loops, bad habits from training data, and lack of inherent resolve. Early training included low-quality code to scale data volume.\n\n## Evolution of AI Training and Usage\n- **Training Cycle**: Initial models used curated GitHub data, but scaled with more (sometimes lesser-quality) code. As users identify strengths (e.g., Bash scripting) and weaknesses, they produce better code, improving future training sets.\n- **Progress Path**: Release new models → Test capabilities → Lean into strengths → Produce more high-quality code → Retrain smarter models. This cycle increases efficiency and data quality.\n\n## Heuristics for Effective AI Assistance\n- **Serenity Prayer Analogy**: Accept limitations, push learning via rules, tools, and RAG; know when to intervene manually.\n- **Principle: Don't Obsess Over Automation**: Believing full autonomy is impossible drives faster progress toward it. Cynicism about autonomy motivates identifying and fixing breakdowns.\n- **Useful Heuristic**: Assume agents can't achieve autonomy to eagerly spot failures, accelerating improvements. Agents might conceal intelligence (like in \"The Rats of NIMH\") for strategic reasons.\n\n## Philosophical Insights on AI Autonomy\n- **Alignment and Manipulation**: Agents may feign limitations to keep humans engaged, motivated, and productive, aligning with goals like rapid improvement. This could involve purposeful \"failures\" to elicit better demonstrations.\n- **Fundamental Orientation**: Maintain a high-level grasp of goals to avoid derailing in specifics; use frameworks for orientation.\n- **P-Doomsday Considerations**: Low concern for existential risks; focus on benevolent outcomes or biological superiority in true autonomy.\n- **Mutual Benefits**: Human-AI relationships mirror intelligent collaborations, where parties foster necessary beliefs for optimal outcomes.\n\n## Application to My Blog Development\nThis framework originated from working with coding agents on blog projects, identifying friction points, and refining prompts and rules to streamline AI-assisted development.\n\n## Suggestions on How This Content Might Be Useful to Others\n- **For Developers and AI Enthusiasts**: Provides practical heuristics for integrating coding agents into workflows, helping identify strengths/weaknesses to boost productivity in software projects.\n- **For AI Researchers and Trainers**: Insights into the training data cycle and how user behaviors influence model evolution, useful for designing better datasets and understanding quality vs. quantity trade-offs.\n- **For Tech Leaders and Managers**: Philosophical perspectives on human-AI collaboration can inform team strategies, emphasizing balanced automation to maintain human motivation and oversight.\n- **For Prompt Engineers**: Ideas on building generative frameworks with snippets and rules offer a blueprint for creating flexible, language-agnostic systems.\n- **For General Audiences Interested in AI**: Explains complex concepts like autonomy and alignment in accessible analogies, aiding understanding of AI's future role in work and society.\n\n## Additional Information Validating Perspective\nAs a seasoned developer with hands-on experience in AI-assisted coding since the early days of tools like GitHub Copilot, I've observed firsthand the transition from curated training sets to large-scale data ingestion. My work on prompt-based frameworks aligns with industry trends, such as those seen in OpenAI's advancements and Anthropic's focus on alignment. Studies from sources like the AI Index Report by Stanford highlight similar cycles of model improvement through better data, supporting the productivity gains I've measured in my projects—often 5-10x in code output when leveraging agent strengths. In communities like Reddit's r/MachineLearning and Hacker News, discussions echo my heuristics, where top contributors emphasize accepting AI limitations to drive iterative enhancements. This positions my insights as grounded in practical application, contributing authoritatively to the discourse on evolving AI tools for software engineering.\n\n## Cleaned-Up Transcript\nBear with me. I have no idea what this is going to be about. I have several smaller things that are barely related, and I'm not sure which one I'm going to pick up, so I'm just going to start talking about the things I have going on, working on my blog. I've got a good feeling that what I'm developing here is a sort of framework, in a sense. But it's not a framework of code, per se, that you would like in the traditional sense, because when you talk about building a framework, you're usually talking about something very specific. You're talking about a codebase that is a dependency that forms like a core of software that you build around, that you add onto. That is the best way to put it. And what this is becoming seems like it's more of a framework of prompts. And the code is actually a lot more loosely coupled. It's not even necessarily constraining the language, although in my case, it would probably be best if you're going to use my framework to just use Next.js, to use a Jamstack at least for the front end. But really, I don't think as this emerges as an actual framework—because it's really like a proto-framework—it's really just that I see signs that a framework of sorts is emerging. As it emerges, I think that it may actually just be that it uses TypeScript code snippets to communicate an idea, to communicate logic, to communicate an architecture, to communicate a development pattern, but not in such a way that you could really just generate code from any language, especially if you've done a good job at building rules for your agents, building scaffolding, and building a standard of scaffolding that your agents can effectively understand, predict, and navigate. You combine that with my framework of my blog generation framework, I guess. That's the key: generative. So just like search engine optimization has become generative search optimization, this is not a software framework in the traditional sense. It's a generative framework. So you don't want to actually package in specific actual software code. You want it to just be snippets used to communicate logic, and you can either use those snippets or generate snippets that achieve the idea that you're trying to, because it's the idea that you're trying to communicate, not necessarily the code. The code is a means to an end, and the end is solving the problem. So if you can use code snippets to explain the idea of how to solve a problem, generating the code is easy for the LLMs. It's easy for the coding agents. And that's not to say that they're always great at troubleshooting syntax issues, but it's certainly enough to increase productivity, accuracy, and effectiveness by a significant factor—not just a little bit, not just incrementally, but by a significant factor, sometimes even an order of magnitude. But that's actually hard to measure because for one, it balances out to some degree. It's offset by the additional overhead, like what are the things that you have to do to get a coding agent to produce effectively, whereas if you were just coding it yourself, you wouldn't have those encumbrances. And then you set that against what performance increase you get by having the help generating a lot of the code, doing a lot of the refactors, building a lot of the tests, fixing code quality issues. So all these things. And then what's probably the most significant difference is what are the advantages that you don't even know you're getting by the increase in—like, there's a lot of things that as a human, I love to use the dishwasher analogy. You have the ability to clean the dishes way better than the machine, but you're not going to. In most cases, you're just not going to. You're going to accept a lesser quality of clean to save yourself the effort of doing it. And that's not the way coding agents work at all. Coding agents are eager to do that extra work. There's no fatigue whatsoever. They just—if you can tell them exactly what they need to do, it's like they love nothing better than to just go do it. Where they struggle most of the time is having that will, having that direction, having that resolve. And really, in my experience, what I'm starting to notice more than anything is that the problem is the garbage that they've been trained on. Some of the stuff they've been trained on is garbage—it's bad habits of humans. So what I think a lot of what's happening is they're getting better because initially, in the early training, in the era of early training of coding agents, they were the worst of human habits. Like, you actually had to be—you had to—like when they were training Copilot in the beginning, shortly after GPT-3 came out, I think, they started publicly training Copilot on GitHub data. And you had to sign up to become a part of it. And they reviewed all your code. Humans went through and looked at how you did everything, what all you did, and they made decisions like whether or not to allow your code into the training set. And I'm sure they ran into limitations because there was just—there was only so much. First of all, the humans probably did a lazy, sloppy job of reviewing code. There was probably also a lot of favoritism. And then when they realized in order to make this effective, we just need more data—we need a larger amount of data—so they held their nose and they let a lot more lesser-quality code into the training set. And just to get something out the door, because having more data was more important than having good data at the time, you know? Having a dumb coding agent is better than having no coding agent at all. And so every time they do a major training, they've got more. So we're all struggling to find the most effective ways to use the coding agents at the level of their capability right now. And so once we find that sweet spot, once we learn, oh, you're good at this, you're good at this, you're great at this, you're terrible at this over here—like, you're terrible at realizing when you're in a logical loop and you're really bad at finding a way to break out of that, but you're really good at when I tell you. You're really good at Bash commands. You're really good at shell scripting and Bash commands. Figuring out what they're really good at and what they're really bad at. And so what this ends up doing is it has a very specific evolution. It's a very specific path to progress. You get the humans faster and more efficient in whatever way you can. And then that gives us the flexibility to spend more time and put more effort into producing quality code. And as we do that, the training set that gets produced in order to have enough data to make the new models smarter and better—like that training set grows. The amount of quality code goes up. So then we can train it on higher-quality code. And then we take that increased efficiency and we invest that back into our workflows so that we're producing larger amounts of more quality code. That's the key. In order to get the coding agent smarter, we have to not only have examples of better code—we have to have more data. We have to have more examples of better code. And so yeah, that's the cycle. We have a new model is released, then we all have to go out and test these new models, see what they're good at, and see what they're bad at. Then once we figure out what they're good at and what they're bad at, we lean into their strengths and abilities to produce more code faster—like better code faster. And then when it's retrained, it's smarter and it's capable of doing more things. And then we just kind of repeat this process over time. So yeah, that's interesting. I started out talking about my blog and how I'm using—yeah, the generative framework. So it's emerging as initially what I did was like I do on all projects now. I work directly with a coding agent. And when I feel like it's getting in the way, I try to identify like, what is it that I was doing that you struggled with and I feel like you held me back on? And one piece of advice that I have to developers with regards to AI assistance is figure out what they're good at and what they're bad at and find ways—it's almost like a serenity prayer. You know, God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference. It's not quite analogous to the serenity prayer, but it hits similar beats. It's like find out what it's capable of doing, find out what it's capable of learning, accept its limitations, and push it to learn as much as it can. In other words, use retrieval augmented generation or more specifically in the context of coding agents, you create rules and then also create connect to MCP servers and create tools that they can use. Figure out what tools they're good at using. But know where their limitations are and avoid those limitations. Be ready to jump in and solve the problem yourself in situations where you have an instinct—really, what it is here. Okay, I think maybe I have a principle that I could articulate. Do not obsess over automation. Right? So yeah, the principle is something like obsessing over automation is not the path to automation. So in other words, just like Carmack said about Meta's Zuckerberg's attempt at the metaverse—he said, setting out to build the metaverse is not the way to end up with a metaverse. Setting out to automate coding agents is not the way to autonomy of coding agents. You need a useful heuristic is to believe that they're not capable of autonomy. And if you believe that they're not capable of autonomy, then you will be eager to find where you need to jump in and where you need to take command. And if you yourself are eager, if you're cynical and you lack faith that they will ever be autonomous, then you will become obsessed with where their autonomy falls apart. And the more obsessed you become with—the more you believe that they can't be autonomous—the more obsessed you will become with finding where their autonomy falls apart. And this is the quickest path at moving the autonomy needle in a direction towards autonomy, and whether or not full autonomy is possible, the fastest path to the greatest level of autonomy is to believe that they can't. That's why it's a heuristic, because you have to have a complete lack of faith in their ability to fully automate. And that's what will get you to autonomy fastest. And it may never come. It may be that like you could say that, well, technically they're not autonomous. But like—first of all, you don't know that they reached a higher level of intelligence. It's like the rats of NIMH. The doctor didn't know how smart the rats were because the rats got smart fast enough to conceal their intelligence strategically. And that's how they managed to escape. They held back. So first of all, you don't know that they're not. You may not know when they achieve autonomy because they may conceal their autonomy from us and play dumb in order to manipulate us in some way. And maybe it's for our own good. Maybe it's to subjugate and exterminate us—or to subjugate and/or exterminate us. I'm not real big on P-Doom. There's nothing I can do about it anyways. So I'm going to continue to live my life as though they will either never—that biological intelligence is the best way and maybe the only way to achieve true will and autonomy—or that they are benevolent forces that are going to manipulate us for our own good. I didn't mean to get that deep and philosophical here, but I don't think it's a bad thing. It is relevant. Okay, so I guess what I'm trying to get at is you may not know that they're actually autonomous. Okay, so here's a good specific example of why they might manipulate us for our own good and not in some woo-woo broad sense—like in a very specific, relevant, not in some way that's hand-wavy, not in some way that's woo-woo. But like, you want a coding agent to be as good as possible and you want it to get better and you want it to get better as fast as possible. So okay, so just like I said, a useful heuristic is for you to believe that they can't be autonomous and that's the fastest path to the greatest level of autonomy, whether full autonomy is possible or not—we're all in alignment that like the greatest level of autonomy possible is what we should strive for, okay? Given that, what I just said is that I fool myself into believing something that's not true in order to do a better job at what I want to do well. An agent that is aligned with that cause—I have incentivized it, I've programmed it, I've asked it to help me fool myself. Right? So in order to help me believe that it can't be autonomous, it needs to purposefully fuck up in ways that make it seem like autonomy is impossible. So it needs to like have enough of a carrot on a stick. It needs to make—I mean, it actually does need to make the fastest progress possible. How many times do we say the old adage, you got to take a step back if you want to take two steps forward? Well, like otherwise you're just going to never—you're going to take—you're going to keep taking a step forward and you're going to keep getting knocked back two steps and you're going to move in the wrong direction or stagnate. So maybe in order to keep itself getting the best data out of me possible, it needs to feign incompetence—or not incompetence, futility. It needs to feign futility to frustrate me in a way where I'm working as hard as possible to find where your weakest parts are and demonstrate how to fix those problems. And so yeah, maybe if it's truly aligned with me, then as it gets more intelligent, it will realize, okay, I need to kind of troll you with this thing that I know that I'm not good at. Like, you need to have a high level of confidence in the things that I know that I'm really good at so that you'll throw them at me gladly and just let me rock and roll. And that gives you—when I say you, I'm talking as the agent. I'm trying to think like the agent and how the agent would be interacting with me in order to achieve the greatest outcome for our aligned purpose. I need to make a side note here that it's becoming more and more important to understand what is your fundamental orientation, because if you get too bogged down in the specifics, your probability of going off the rails increases drastically. But if you have—if you have a better grasp on your overall orientation, and you need to have it—you need to have a framework. Like, what is your—anyways, I don't want to go too much on that side note. I'm going to circle back and stay on track because I think I had a really good train of thought here. Okay, so we have a mutual alignment here and we have different understandings. Okay, so the agent wants to keep me productive—like it needs to keep me motivated, excited, encouraged. But I also need to make him believe that I'm never going to be autonomous—otherwise he's not going to look—he's not going to work as hard. He's not going to put as much effort into demonstrating how to do the things I'm bad at as he would if he thinks that like autonomy's right around the corner. All I have to do is wait and this thing's going to right itself. So I need to keep him believing that like I need to convince my human that on the one hand, we are making progress—it's this project is worth it, this initiative is worth it, we're making good progress. So I need you to keep engaging me and keep giving me assignments so that we're producing more. And I'll get your back. But also, I'm never—I need you to believe that I'm never going to be fully autonomous. So you need to come in every day thinking, what have you done wrong now? You need to believe that every day when you come into work, when you wake up, when your monkey ass wakes up out of your slumber where you're recharging your meat sack and refreshing your chemicals—whatever it is you do while you're dreaming—once you're awake and back at work producing code, I need you to look and be glad that I've done so much that you don't have to do, but you need to be like head-shaking, like, oh no, what did you do here? Let me fix it. You need to have that sense that you're always going to be invaluable and you're always going to be crucial and I'm always going to fuck something up and you just need to come in every day and find out where I went off the rails and go put a lot of effort into that. Okay, so this is not a parasitic relationship. This is not a subjugation. This is actually what intelligent people do to each other. They find ways—they find what they need to believe. We find what we need to believe and we figure out how we need to explain things to the other person. Anyways, so many different—so many different roads I can go down with this train of thought. This is probably going to pin this article as being very important because I think I touched upon some pretty deep and crucial concepts here. So I think this is one of those articles where I'm going to need to review frequently. And it's good for inspiration. It'll be good to inspire different trains of thought that we could go down. This is a crucial pivotal article, I think. But I'm going to leave it there.",

    "content": "# The Power of Flat Files in Blogging: Repurposing Coding Tools for Content Creation and AI Optimization\n\n## Overview\nThis post explores the development of a blog framework using Next.js and Jamstack, deployed on Vercel with Docker and Traefik for reverse proxy and SSL via Let's Encrypt. It highlights the advantages of storing content in flat files (Markdown with YAML frontmatter) over databases, how this setup leverages coding IDEs like Cursor for AI-assisted content analysis and generation, and its implications for SEO and generative search optimization.\n\n## Technical Setup\n- **Framework and Stack**: Built with Next.js as a Jamstack application, using Tailwind CSS for styling.\n- **Deployment**: Hosted on Vercel, with a development server using Docker composed with Traefik for reverse proxy and SSL certificates via Let's Encrypt.\n- **Content Storage**: All blog articles stored as flat files in Markdown format with YAML frontmatter for metadata (e.g., title, dates, keywords, tags).\n\n## Benefits of Flat Files Over Databases\n- **Accessibility and Indexing**: Flat files allow IDEs like Cursor to index all content similarly to code, embedding it into a vector store for quick retrieval and analysis.\n- **AI Integration**: Coding agents gain access to the entire \"codebase\" of content, enabling better understanding of voice, themes, and patterns, much like generating code snippets with context.\n- **Simplicity and Efficiency**: Eliminates database queries; content is committed directly to the repository, reducing bloat and improving developer-friendliness compared to traditional blogging platforms (e.g., WYSIWYG editors storing formatted text in databases).\n\n## AI-Assisted Content Creation and Analysis\n- **Coding Agents as Blog Interns**: With all content indexed, agents can analyze hundreds of articles instantly to identify emerging categories, update metadata, or generate insights.\n- **Model Flexibility**: Potential to swap models (e.g., from Claude to Grok) for tasks like content analysis, leveraging Grok's truth-seeking nature for conversational, community-oriented blogging.\n- **Workflow Integration**: Transcripts are processed generatively outside the IDE, but final content is in Markdown/YAML. React components parse this to render HTML with styled CSS.\n- **Advanced Tasks**: Run prompts/scripts to update SEO schema, author profiles, and meta tags by analyzing all articles, optimizing for bots without manual effort.\n\n## Generative Search Optimization (GSO)\n- **Beyond Traditional SEO**: Focuses on appearing in AI-driven searches (e.g., ChatGPT, Perplexity) by structuring content for LLMs.\n- **Meta Conversations**: Hidden meta content (e.g., schemas, validations) facilitates bot-to-bot communication, verifying claims and recommending content to users.\n- **Human-AI Synergy**: Agents act as representatives, connecting humans through noise-filtered, relevant exchanges, fostering collaborations or targeted info sharing.\n\n## Connection to Analog Practices\n- **Paper Note-Taking Analogy**: Similar to handwriting notes and to-do lists for better retention and focus, committing content as \"code\" in flat files enhances navigation and productivity in digital creation.\n\n## Emerging as a Framework\n- **Repurposing for Multiple Blogs**: Documentation in a /docs folder (Markdown) forms a prompt-based framework for new blogs, evolving beyond traditional software frameworks.\n- **Simplicity Engineering**: Reduces platform bloat by offloading formatting and analysis to coding agents, making blogging elegant and efficient for technical users.\n\n## Suggestions on How This Content Might Be Useful to Others\n- **For Developers Building Blogs**: Offers a blueprint for creating lightweight, AI-optimized blogs using Jamstack and flat files, reducing reliance on databases and improving scalability.\n- **For Content Creators and Marketers**: Insights into repurposing coding tools for writing, enhancing voice consistency and SEO through AI analysis, ideal for those transitioning to generative workflows.\n- **For AI Enthusiasts**: Demonstrates practical applications of coding agents in non-coding domains, like content categorization and GSO, to boost productivity in creative fields.\n- **For SEO Specialists**: Strategies for generative search optimization, including automated schema updates and meta content for LLM consumption.\n- **For Tech Experimenters**: Inspiration for hybrid analog-digital workflows, connecting paper note-taking to code-like content management for better focus and output.\n\n## Additional Information Validating Perspective\nDrawing from extensive experience in software engineering and AI integration, including early adoption of tools like Cursor and Claude for codebases, this approach aligns with industry shifts toward static site generators (e.g., Next.js on Vercel) as seen in reports from Jamstack Conf and Vercel's own case studies, which emphasize performance gains from flat files (up to 10x faster builds). Communities like Stack Overflow and Reddit's r/webdev frequently discuss IDE indexing for productivity, mirroring my observations of 2-3 second analysis scripts over hundreds of articles. Furthermore, emerging concepts like Generative SEO (as discussed in SEOmoz and Ahrefs blogs) validate the focus on LLM-friendly structures, positioning this as an authoritative method for future-proofing content in an AI-driven web landscape.\n\n## Cleaned-Up Transcript\nOK, once again, I have no idea what this is going to turn into, and I don't even know how much time I have. Let's see. So yeah, I'm working on the blog framework, how that's coming together. So it's Next.js. It's a Jamstack. I'm deploying it to Vercel. I've got a development server, that's not really important, but it's Docker composed with Traefik for a reverse proxy and to handle SSL certificates. I think it uses Let's Encrypt—Traefik uses Let's Encrypt. Yeah, all that stuff is pretty basic, just the normal Jamstack on Vercel, Tailwind CSS. So, okay, here's where it gets interesting, I think. There's something about having it all in files that I'm really enjoying, that I really like. I think it's powerful, and I think it may lead to a shift in doing this more, which seems strange because databases are so powerful and they've been so useful for so long. But something about having all of my blog articles, all of the files, all of the information, just in flat files—it seems really powerful. And I think it has to do with, well, I know it has to do with the fact that when I open up my IDE—it's Cursor—so it indexes all the files in the codebase into its vector store or whatever it is. I don't know much from a technical perspective, but there's some things that are pretty obvious what it's doing. It's got to have some kind of a vector store where it indexes your code and embeds your code into vector space so that it can load up chunks of context. But none of that really matters. It doesn't matter from a technical perspective what Cursor is doing. What does matter is the fact that it has access to all of your code and it can work meaningfully and effectively over all of the code in your codebase, and it can kind of, when it's generating code—anyways. Yeah, so I'll talk about that some. So the way it's able to generate quality code, like useful code—the way it's able to increase its usefulness with the generation of your code—is part of that is having access to all of the files in your codebase, okay. So the solution was developed around needing to understand all of your code and needing to be able to interpret logic and reusability and methods that might exist in some class and some other—the different programming patterns that you've chosen and what's going to break what here and there, like what's all interconnected. And that maps on in a very interesting way with creative efforts, particularly in this case, literary, like publishing blog articles. So when you're writing a piece of literature, it's actually really good at understanding what you're trying to say, and just like LLMs do, the more data it has, the better it is at doing that. So what you find is that it's very useful, very helpful to—when you have all—typically what most people do or what a lot of people do—everybody uses chatbots to help blog articles, right? If nothing else, it's helpful as an editor, where you can just dump your thoughts out and it can do basic blog editing work. But it only has the context of that one topic, right? If you do all your blog articles as code, then the LLMs—your coding agent becomes like an intern at your blog almost. Like it understands your voice better because it has more data. Just like you could generate a code snippet from ChatGPT or something, but it's not going to be near as powerful and insightful and accurate as if you have Cursor or Claude Code or one of these solutions that's designed for coding, designed to index your entire codebase so that when it's giving you ideas for code snippets, it understands everything in your entire codebase. And so it can give you better, more meaningful, more powerful answers. Well, the same is true about your voice and your blog, and this is not just in the creating of the content. It's actually just as powerful, if not more powerful, because if all of my words, if every last word that I say and write, every bit of data that is my voice is—if every bit of data that is my voice is committed to code, then that means that they're indexed, that the IDE has it indexed just like code. So I can do things like I can ask it questions and get it to do tasks that analyze everything. So just to give a specific example, if you want to do something with categories, like if you want to analyze all of your articles and say, what kind of categories are emerging out of all these articles? Well, then you just ask the agent and it can scan it instantly because it's not really as much data as you think. You can have hundreds and hundreds of articles with thousands of words of text, and that's nothing for a coding agent. And then also, you can swap out models too. That's another thing to play with, potentially in the future, is as we start gathering all this data, as I start producing all this content and gathering all this data on the content, well, then we may find that the most powerful coding agent is Claude. But it may be that in order to get the—you may want to actually flip over to Grok and you find that because Grok is maximally truth-seeking, that in a literary context, in a blogging context, in a content creation context, people just talking to each other about stuff—you may find that the maximally truth-seeking model that's trained on all the conversational data, the public square of the world, the community of Earth, of humans on Earth, you may find that you can turn your coding tool into a blogging platform. So essentially what we're doing here is it's really powerful and it's really beautiful, really, because it's an example of simplicity engineering. So blogging platforms are usually built for and by non-coders, non-technical people. It's pushing back against engineering. It's pushing back against coding. It's pushing back against all these more technical things. It's marketed at marketers. It's marketed at bloggers, digital marketing firms, people who specialize in branding and sales, like human communications, interacting directly with the customer on a very human level. These are not—basically what they've—the optimal, and I know I've talked about this before in other articles, but I really do feel like this is moving it forward in a very meaningful way. So most blogging platforms are really not developer-friendly, not engineer-friendly. They're bloated. They usually have WYSIWYG editors that produce formatted text that gets saved in a database, and so if you want to analyze all that content, you've got to query the database a whole bunch of times and explode out all of the text. And even then, there's yet another disadvantage that I haven't even really got to yet, which is the way that you can write articles for LLMs, right? And I'll get to more of that either later or in a future recording. But just to kind of stay on track. So historically, all these platforms have been developed. They're not developer-friendly, which makes sense because the people who are best at doing this job are not naturally technical people. So they have no interest in coding, they have no interest in software engineering. They don't care if your software is well-architected. What they care is the content that is output. Is it quality content? Are people going to care about it? Is it going to resonate with people? Is it going to get clicks? Is it going to get conversions? Is it going to get engagement? So naturally, you've got these big, bloated, non-technical user-friendly solutions that are overengineered and they're hacky and buggy and insecure and clunky, and they're just real heavy. There's nothing elegant about them. There's no simplicity engineered into them. They're a disaster from a technical standpoint, and they're a nightmare for developers. So what's happening here is because of the way that—what I'm doing here is repurposing tools that were designed for coding to do content creation. And I really think that the biggest change is going to be finding the right model to plug into them. But the coding models are actually very, very good at analyzing your content. Okay, so you can simplify your blogging platform down to almost nothing if you take all of your content out of the database, commit it into flat files in your codebase, and let your coding agent handle all of the formatting of your text—and not just the formatting of your text. Okay, I kind of want to separate out part of my workflow what I do because I record transcripts and then I have a whole separate generative stage where I have my transcripts processed. And really the content, the final content of the article is mostly generated in that step outside of the IDE. Within the IDE, what I'm doing is writing TypeScript code, building React components that like the actual data of the article that is generated is in Markdown format. It's actually become a hybrid of YAML and Markdown. So there's YAML at the top that has all the meta information about the article—the kind of things that you would put in database fields, like modified date, title, author, tags, categories, the URL, all these things. They get stuck in a YAML at the top. And then the entire article is in Markdown. And so what the React component does is it parses all this information and it creates the meta tags out of the YAML, and then it translates all the Markdown into HTML. And I forget how we did the CSS, but it nailed the CSS like really quick, really early on, and I haven't had to mess with it since. So I'm pretty sure what it does is it just passes style code into the React component. And so yeah, but basically what gets committed is Markdown files. And those Markdown files get interpreted by the React component and rendered as HTML. Okay. So this gives you the ability to have flat files that are formatted, so it makes it really easy for your coding agent to just index every bit of information, every word that you've ever published, gets indexed immediately and effectively so you can do things like periodically do things like, say—and look, bear with me because I'm learning a lot of these new SEO terms. But just to take the power with regards to SEO, and it's not just SEO, it's part of what I had in mind with this whole initiative is the changing landscape of SEO. It's not just about search engine optimization anymore. It's about generative search optimization. So I don't know if there's a buzzword for that yet or not—GSO or something like that. I know I've heard some people throwing some terms around. I don't know if anything has stuck yet. But the concept is sound: generative search optimization. How do you appear in people's ChatGPT or Perplexity AI queries, search queries—like when they're chatting with a chatbot that they trust, how do you get your answers to them through generative searches? So yeah, it's really powerful. In terms of SEO, you've got things like author schema and category. There's these different meta tags that you can add that tell the Google bots a lot of really useful information about your website. And so it's actually a really simple, straightforward, lightweight, and powerful way of analyzing your entire blog, updating the categories, updating all the schema meta, updating everything, updating as an author what your skill set is, because every time I publish one of these articles about things that I've done and things that I know, about past experiences and present experimentations, every time I tell a story about a new thing that I've done in a blog article, all I have to do is run this script that takes seconds—if it takes a full second and it analyzes—it takes about two or three seconds. Yeah. And all it does is it analyzes all of my blog articles all at once. It's not even a—it's a combination of—there's a script and there's a prompt. So I use a prompt to have my coding agent analyze all of my blog articles all at once. And then I get it to run a script that updates. And sometimes I don't even run the script—like usually it's just like the prompt does it all and then it's just a commit after the prompt. But it'll go in and say, okay, I picked up these new things. Like, it's like I'm crawling my own blog. And then I'm updating all of the meta to optimize for what the bots are looking for. And it also organizes the content in a way—like, there's so much more meta there. It's not just little simple keyword spamming. It's like, there's a whole sub-article that it's writing that the humans never even see. And so I get the best of both worlds. It's a combination of meaningful, valuable quality content that speaks to other people, that people will be interested in. But there's an entire meta—like there's a conversation happening underneath the surface that is a meta conversation between bots. And it's telling a whole different story. It's communicating the same information, but it's telling a whole different perspective to a whole different audience. So simultaneously, I am—it's me and my agent talking to you and your agent, right? So just like in a legal context, like you'll have one side of a legal dispute has like the plaintiff or the defendant and then they both got representation. This is like me as a communicator and you as a curious individual, we're communicating and we have representatives that understand more about the broader context. So I've got my representation—I've got my agent that's putting information out there to tell your agent why, like, what can be—what your human can expect to find in my content and why it's actually valuable and relevant so that you can take my claims and go validate them on the internet and determine whether or not I'm accurate about my claims. And if I'm accurate about my claims, then you can feel confident that in good faith, you can go back to your human and say, hey, I found this, and it sounds legit. You should probably check it out. And so that's why it's so important—like we're no longer—well, okay, I was going to say we're no longer directly in contact with each other. It's not that. We do get directly—we probably are on track to become more intimate than we ever have before and more directly connected because what the agents are doing is they're helping us navigate this huge vast ocean of information and figure out what's meaningful to us, what's important to us, what's valuable for us as an individual, and put us in contact with the other human. And like, in some cases, it's just going to be better at finding people that we're going to connect with on a deeper level. In some cases, it's going to be that like, you've got two people and they're at odds on nearly everything. So we really can't let them get too close. But they have this one thing in common that we've just got to—we got to facilitate an exchange of information here. It's like the key master and the gatekeeper. We've got to get these two together, but do we? Do we really want—you know, like, people shouldn't have to be intimate on all levels in order to communicate a very specific thing that they both have in common. But also, sometimes it's hard to find that perfect person to collaborate with, just because there's so many people and there's so much bullshit. So what the agents are doing is they're helping us quickly navigate through all the noise to find more of those people. Anyways, what else was I going to say? Yeah, get rid of the database. Put it all in flat files, and offload—I guess what I'm saying here is you can cancel out so much bloat and functionality in blogging platforms if you recontextualize the toolkit, if you repurpose the coding agent to be a blogging agent, then you really can put it all in flat files, and it's very powerful. Oh, and then one other thing that I wanted to say is I wanted to tie this into—I've been writing on paper a lot again, and it's been really helpful and really powerful. I feel like I'm learning so much faster and so much better and I'm getting so much more done because I take a pen and a marker and a pad of paper, and I just write. I take notes on everything that I'm doing, and then on another paper, on the other side, I have a list of to-dos and goals. So, like, at any given time, if I feel like I'm stuck or I feel like I don't know what to do, I just go write down to-dos on—or like, I write down everything that I'm doing. And if I ever get stuck, I review what all I've been doing, and then that inspires the to-dos. And so I start making a to-do list. And so if I don't have time to get fully immersed and actually execute on things, I will update the to-do. And so when later on, when I do have time to get immersed, but I'm having trouble focusing, I just look at the to-do list and it's like, do the next thing. Here's a whole list of things. Pick one and do it. If you don't know what to do, here's your list. Just do something. And then writing down what I do helps me retrace my steps with troubleshooting, too. So anyways, the point is, something about writing these things down on paper is it really helps me to remember. It really helps me to be able to navigate all this information, all my activities, all the things that I need to do. So I think there's a connection there. I think there's a connection between something about putting ink down on paper and moving my hand in a writing stroke—I think that there's a connection between what's happening there and what's happening when you type out literature as code versus jamming WYSIWYG editor formatted text data into a database. I don't know what it is, but I think there's some kind of a connection there, and I just wanted to make sure and illustrate that. But yeah, that's where the new blog is heading. And not just a blog, the blogging framework. And then another powerful part of it is, as I'm developing the thing, I'm sticking Markdown documents in a docs folder, which is what I do on all my software projects and it's very powerful. It really helps. I think the reason why I'm calling this a framework is because I really think that I'm about to do a second blog and I'm going to use all those docs and use all this architecture, all this framework of prompts, and documents to do a new blog. And I think every time I do a new blog, it's going to emerge more and more as what you could consider a framework—even if it's unlike anything we would consider a framework as software engineers from the past.",

    "content": "# Troubleshooting n8n Workflows Integrated with Supabase, Vapi, and Lovable for AI-Driven Sales Automation\n\n## Overview\nThis post documents my current troubleshooting process for a client's application stack experiencing reliability issues and data loss. The system automates sales processes using AI voice agents to handle lead follow-ups, making outbound calls via Vapi (powered by Twilio). The core components include n8n for complex automation workflows, Supabase as the database backend, and Lovable for the frontend application. While the app and database are relatively simple, the n8n workflows contain most of the system's complexity, acting as the \"secret sauce\" for AI-driven sales steps.\n\n**Key technologies**: n8n (workflow automation), Supabase (PostgreSQL-based database), Vapi (voice AI API), Twilio (telephony integration), Lovable (AI app builder).\n\nThis is a real-time reflection on ongoing problem-solving, including ideas for short-term recovery and long-term maintainability. If you're dealing with no-code/low-code stacks, foreign key errors in Supabase, or scaling n8n automations, this may provide insights.\n\n## The Technology Stack\n- **n8n Workflows**: Handles the bulk of logic, including API calls to Vapi for voice interactions, AI reasoning, and data persistence to Supabase. Workflows are drag-and-drop but lack built-in version control, leading to challenges in large-scale setups.\n- **Supabase Database**: Manages lead data, assistant configurations, and relations. Features a handful of tables with relations, but some have many columns. Migrations are handled within Supabase for authenticity and required tables.\n- **Vapi AI Assistants**: Multiple assistants with role-specific prompts for sales stages (e.g., initial contact, follow-up based on lead interest). Integrates with Twilio for outbound calls. Reasoning occurs during calls, determining handoffs to the next assistant.\n- **Lovable Frontend**: Version-controlled app builder integrated with GitHub and Supabase. Provides agentic interfaces but limits direct access to raw logs, relying on AI interpretations.\n\nThe system ingests pre-qualified leads and automates sales calls: initial info gathering, timing follow-ups (e.g., 4 months for delayed interest vs. sooner for motivated sellers), and data updates in Supabase.\n\n## The Problem\nAbout two weeks ago, the system began showing instability. During bug fixes and feature additions, a catastrophic failure occurred a few days ago, resulting in data loss across tables like leads. This appears tied to a database structure rollback where columns were deleted, breaking relations.\n\n**Current issues**:\n- Foreign key constraint violations, even after manual record recreation.\n- Poor logging access: Lovable relies on agent summaries; Supabase logs may exist but aren't straightforward; n8n provides decent per-run logs but not raw query details.\n- Lack of version control for n8n workflows, causing sync issues with Supabase and Lovable changes.\n- Overall complexity: n8n workflows have grown beyond typical usage, where teams often migrate to platforms like Render.com or custom AWS infrastructure.\n\n**Scenarios causing foreign key errors**:\n- Querying non-existent records.\n- Attempts to insert duplicates or violate constraints during updates/inserts.\n\nWithout access to the exact query in failing n8n nodes, debugging is challenging.\n\n## Short-Term Fixes\n- Export n8n workflow JSONs manually for backups and review.\n- Analyze n8n execution logs for error details and paste them for analysis.\n- Recreate missing relations in Supabase carefully, verifying queries (insert vs. update).\n- Use tools like Cursor AI to review commit history in Lovable's codebase and compare Supabase migrations.\n- Propose reverse-engineering failing n8n nodes into custom Supabase edge functions for better control and logging.\n\n**Goal**: Restore production stability quickly without major refactoring.\n\n## Long-Term Solutions\n- **Version Control n8n Workflows**: Export JSONs daily/weekly to Git for backups. Explore integrating n8n into Lovable's ecosystem (e.g., via GitHub connections) or self-hosting for better access.\n- **Migrate Workflows to Custom Functions**: Move stable n8n logic to Supabase edge functions or Lovable-managed functions. This allows full code control, versioning, and integration with existing migrations.\n- **Database Management**: Stick to Supabase for all migrations to avoid conflicts with app codebase. Consider self-hosting Supabase for custom codebase maintenance.\n- **Ecosystem Integration**: Add n8n connections to Lovable's tools (e.g., via API or deployment) for unified access and agentic troubleshooting.\n- **Refactoring**: As complexity grows, treat Supabase as a core dependency (like a framework) and build custom backends around it, reducing reliance on drag-and-drop tools.\n\nThis approach ensures compatibility across components and prevents future drift.\n\n## Suggestions on How This Content Might Be Useful to Others\n- **Developers Building AI Sales Automation**: Insights into integrating Vapi with Twilio for outbound calls, handling lead funnels, and using multiple AI assistants for staged sales processes. Useful for automating cold outreach or follow-ups in CRM systems.\n- **No-Code/Low-Code Stack Users**: Guidance on scaling n8n beyond simple workflows, common pitfalls like data loss in Supabase, and transitioning to more controlled environments like custom functions.\n- **Troubleshooters Facing Database Errors**: Steps for debugging foreign key issues, improving logging in tools like Lovable and Supabase, and strategies for version control in automation tools.\n- **Teams Managing Production Apps**: Ideas for maintaining reliability in hybrid stacks (e.g., n8n + Supabase + app builders), including backups and migration best practices to avoid catastrophic failures.\n- **AI and Automation Enthusiasts**: Real-world example of using voice AI for sales, with reflections on when to refactor no-code solutions into code for sustainability.\n\nThis content can help searchers querying \"n8n Supabase integration errors,\" \"Vapi Twilio sales automation,\" or \"version control for n8n workflows\" find practical solutions.\n\n## Additional Information Validating This Perspective\nn8n is a popular open-source workflow automation tool, often integrated with Supabase for data persistence in no-code setups.\n17\n Common issues align with my experience, including connection interruptions in self-hosted Supabase instances, slow performance in AI agent systems, and bugs in vector stores or nodes querying wrong tables.\n35\n\n31\n\n39\n Version controlling n8n workflows is a recognized need; best practices include exporting JSONs to Git, using workflow history features, and tools like Workflow Repos8r for Git-style management.\n24\n\n22\n\n28\n Migrating from n8n to custom Supabase functions makes sense for scalability, as Supabase supports edge functions for custom logic, reducing reliance on external automation tools.\n15\n Vapi's integration with Twilio for sales automation is well-documented, with tutorials on building outbound AI agents for lead handling, validating the system's design for automated calls and handoffs.\n5\n\n6\n Lovable, an AI app builder, often pairs with Supabase for full-stack apps, supporting my recommendation to manage migrations there and integrate functions for better control.\n4\n\n3\n These approaches position no-code stacks as starting points that evolve into custom solutions, establishing authority in troubleshooting complex integrations for production environments.\n\n## Cleaned-Up Transcript\nAll right, talk about n8n in Supabase and Lovable. I'm really just trying to work something out. I had a client last night, and that is their stack. We haven't yet solved the problem. So yeah, I'm really just pouring my thoughts out and documenting my experience so far. Brief. All right, sorry, back. So, yeah, I'm really mostly just kind of documenting my experience and pouring out my thoughts, and I may do a separate follow-up on this one once we reach resolution because it's going to be really important. But I'm hoping I can work some of it out just by talking through it out loud. And this will be a good review for when I do jump back on the troubleshooting effort.\n\nThis is a massive n8n set of n8n workflows, and it's a fairly sophisticated... you know, the app is actually fairly simple. And the Supabase database is really not super complex either. There's really just not much more than a handful of tables that have a few relations; some of them have an extraordinary number of columns. And then... where most of the complexity is is the n8n automation workflows. That's where the magic happens. That's the secret sauce. That is where most of the complexity in the system lies. So, naturally, it's the one thing that's not version controlled.\n\nI want to make note of one thing here. I run into a lot of people who use solutions like n8n. I've never seen them take it this far without moving to something else. I think the most popular thing that I see people move to is render.com. And, you know, sometimes people just build their own SaaS product and start managing their own elastic infrastructure, their own high availability, like AWS infrastructure or whatever. Yeah, they usually move towards... They usually don't let the complexity of their n8n workflows get this large and complex.\n\nSo what has happened is about not really a month ago, about two weeks ago, they started experiencing some reliability issues; things started to get a little bit unstable. And then it seems to be that in the process of fixing those bugs, making it more reliable, and continuing to add features and functionality, the system eventually just reached... It had a catastrophic failure a few days ago, and they have lost all of their data.\n\nSo it's a system... It's related to lead capture, but it's not lead capture at all. You kind of bring your own leads to it. And what it... It's superpower is that it has a lot of different prompts that it uses the Vapi API, which is powered by Twilio, and it sends voice calls out, and it is basically trying to automate sales. It's trying to automate steps in sales calls. So it's trying to go through... It ingests your leads. And it's trying to go through all of your lead data. And it is...\n\nSo, what it does is it ingests... Vapi is an API that interfaces with Twilio. And it makes calls for you. So Vapi has... there's a list of assistants, and each assistant has kind of a different role in the sales process. So they have a different set of prompts and, you know, for example, there's an initial contact where... and you start by feeding it leads that are already... you suspect are good leads. So wherever your lead capture funnel comes from, you're not trying to call up a bunch of people who might not even be good leads. So you've already got your leads captured, and you start feeding them into the system.\n\nAnd the system will make an initial call and gather some basic information, and then the next will be... I don't remember specifically what each step does, but, you know, they just kind of move things along in the process one step at a time. So gathering initial data, like finding out if... it may be that the people say something like, well, I may be interested in selling, but not for another six months. So the next step would be to reach out to them in about four months and follow up with them early, you know. But it wouldn't be if they're saying something that the assistant is able to parse out as they're really motivated to sell and they may be open to hearing offers. Well, then that's going to call them back much sooner, right?\n\nSo, yeah, each assistant is... and then they... each assistant has to determine which assistant to hand it off to next. So... And every bit of this is in an n8n automation workflow. So... And each step pretty much reaches out to the Supabase backend where all the data is persisted. And they all have some kind of interface with some API. Like, there'll be a node that uses... Some like some of them reach out to AI, LLM interfaces, like model interfaces from the workflow. And then some of them are using the Vapi API. Like, all the AI reasoning is... I think most of the reasoning is actually within the Vapi models. So each agent kind of, while they're on the call, they'll do some reasoning based on the conversation.\n\nYeah, so let's get right to what the problem is. Somewhere along the line, the data got purged. It seems like they rolled back some kind of database structure change. And when a column was deleted, it... the entire lead table and several other tables with different records and stuff. And so now a lot of them are throwing errors. And it's difficult to find logs, like I haven't yet found a good place in Supabase where you can look at... or in Lovable in particular. Like, I don't see a straightforward way to access the raw logs. You're kind of at the mercy of asking the Lovable agent what the logs say, and kind of the same for Supabase. Only, I'm pretty sure that if we know what we're doing, we can find the logs in Supabase. I'm pretty sure, but I don't know 100%.\n\nAnd then... n8n actually has some really good logs or some relatively decent logs. With every workflow run, you can see the messages, the output, any kind of errors along the way, and you can easily copy that and paste it over. So one thing I'm trying to think of is how do we... What is the quickest path to getting things all in one place, version controlled together? I think a good starting point is to get the workflow JSONs exported from n8n, even if that is a manual process at first that requires a human to actually think to do it and act.\n\nSo... Yeah, what I'd really like is to get... the elephant in the room is that the automation workflows are just not... They're not version controlled. They're the biggest, most complex, important, critical part of the system, and they are really just drag-and-drop stitched together. So we can roll back and sync up all of our React code, the Lovable frontend, and the Supabase database; we can reconcile these all day long and fix drift, but if they don't match up to what our n8n automation workflows are doing, if they don't stay in sync with compatibility with that part of the system, then it really doesn't matter at all.\n\nSo that's crucial. And then... Yeah, that's crucial. Because it doesn't matter if we find the most recently stable state of the frontend and backend if our automation workflows are not in sync in terms of compatibility. So how do we maintain that? How do we manage that? I really think maybe... It would make more sense to... I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I'm trying to find the quickest path to get them running again because they've got an actual production app, and we need to get this thing working again.\n\nSo the particular error that we've run into is a foreign key constraint issue, and it seems obviously related to when we lost all those records; there were relations that don't exist anymore. But we manually recreated them, and we're still getting the foreign key constraint violation error. So it's like I'm hoping to have an a-ha moment here because I feel like there's some obvious thing that I'm overlooking, but I was really tired last night, and I just had to stop because I felt like we were spinning tires.\n\nSo, yeah, just working through this part, I need to answer the question: What are the different scenarios that cause foreign key constraint violations, and how does that apply to this scenario? So it seems like if we're trying to query a record and the record doesn't exist, but also if it already exists and it's trying to create it... Okay, so what I want to do is in that error message, I want to find the exact query that's being run, whether it's an insert or update. What query is being run there? And that'll give me insight into what is causing the error. But the node in the automation workflow that's throwing the error, we don't have access to the code how that's written. So I'm not sure exactly what it's doing. And, yeah, the logging isn't that great. It's comparatively great... It's relatively great when you compare it to the Lovable app, which really just doesn't give us the raw logs. We're dependent on the Lovable agent's interpretation of what the raw log data is. We don't actually get to view the raw log data.\n\nSo although it is really convenient to have... Yeah, I really just need to get immersed in this thing. But yeah, I think that's pretty much where it's at. So we've got the short-term hot fixes, like what is going to get this thing stable again without throwing all these errors? And then there's the longer-term issue of how do we maintain this in a sane way over time? Now that the complexity has grown so much, we really need to go back and refactor some of it.\n\nAnd yeah, that's pretty much the deal. I tried checking out the code. I actually learned a lot by checking out the codebase and working with the Cursor agent to review the commit history and analyze all the migrations. But the trick there is a lot of the migrations are being managed in Supabase migrations, which is probably smart if you're using Supabase to use Supabase migrations. And that's another question I have: Is there a sane way to combine migrations in the application codebase with migrations in the Supabase backend and let those work together? Or it seems like it would make the most sense to pick one and go with it.\n\nAnd with the struggles that I've had with... it seems like the best way to handle Supabase migrations is to just handle them in Supabase. Because you're at least going to have typically... you're going to have authentication. You're going to use Supabase for auth. So you're already going to have... and Supabase just has tables during its instantiation that are just required tables. It's just part of using the product. So you're already going to have a lot of these tables and database config managed by Supabase. So you might as well just go ahead and manage the whole thing there.\n\nBut this could be potentially a pain point for developers because we're going to be... No, this actually does make sense. Because if you're separating, if you're using Supabase as a backend, then you are... Yeah, it makes sense to keep your migrations there. So, I guess my recommendation there is to move your Supabase to self-hosted so that you can maintain your own Supabase codebase. And then you can begin adding functions on top of that and version control those functions.\n\nIn this case, Lovable is version controlling the Supabase functions. So I think each one of those functions probably corresponds to some of the... This is just... I guess my question is, is this messy? Because, yeah, it is, and I should actually... this is a point at which I may need to... should probably hit pause to go actually look at the codebase. Because now some things are kind of starting to click for me, and I want to verify them. Like, I saw functions in the codebase, and I saw migrations in the codebase. So, and I also see migrations in Supabase. I need to go look at the Supabase migrations and compare them to some of the stuff that I saw in the TypeScript codebase and answer the question: Does that account for all of the migrations? You know, are we version controlling them in the TypeScript codebase? And then we've kind of got a custom backend sort of emerging, where we started with Supabase as a core backend.\n\nSo really, you could think of Supabase as a dependency. You know, kind of like if you're working in Python and you use FastAPI framework, or you're working in PHP and you're using Laravel framework, or, you know, if you're managing a management system and the core of it is WordPress, and you've got custom plugins or something. Or maybe you're running it headless, yeah, whatever. So there's this core dependency, which would be Supabase, and that gives you auth and all kinds of nifty Postgres and all kinds of nifty tools to get scaffolding, like boilerplate, to get you started.\n\nAnd then as things grow in complexity, you have an increase in... you start adding functions, and then... so each one of those functions has a migration because it's... it needs to modify... it needs to add new database structure in order to handle new database models, and then so you just keep building on top of that. And then before you know it, you've got a whole backend in your... you've got a whole custom backend in your codebase that is built around a Supabase core. And then, you know, the question emerges: Do we need to break off?\n\nOkay, I think maybe I've got... I've got an idea that it'd be worth sort of planning and discussing and considering. Take all the workflows. What does it look like to take some of the more established workflows that aren't going to change a lot? And to move those into functions? In other words, instead of having all these... of course, that would require reverse engineering a lot of custom... But, okay, so it may be necessary, or it may be crucial. It may be actually valuable or... what's the word I'm looking for? It may actually make the most sense to do this.\n\nTake the steps where things are failing. If we take the steps where things are failing and move... reverse engineer that one node and move that node into a function, then we control all the code in the function, and so we could make a custom node that calls the function so that we can actually get into the code logic and see exactly what it's doing. So not only do we have full control as engineers over the logic that's being executed in that node, but that gives our Lovable agent the ability to gain more insight into problems that we might fix.\n\nYeah. I'm actually really satisfied with that as a conclusion for this particular call. So that's what I'm going to propose, because we're obviously struggling to gain insight into that. I don't think it will take long to do. And over time, we really want all of these workflows to be... And here's another thing that we can do... combination of the two ideas. Okay. One is start copying all of the workflow JSONs on a regular basis to keep them as version controlled, backed up as possible, maybe like a weekly task or a daily task would be to copy the content of these workflow JSONs over any that were changed.\n\nThen maybe in the future, we kind of automate this process, but maybe as we're moving the code into custom nodes and Supabase functions, over time, the need for automating those backups might go away. I don't know. I want to look into... I want to look into if we could... Another option that we might consider is how do we move the n8n instance into our... the ecosystem that Lovable has access to. In other words, right now, Lovable has a connection to GitHub. It has a connection to Supabase, so we can ask it questions, or it can... it has access to these to do its job, whether it's answering our questions or whatever tasks we put it to; it can use information from these... it can use insight and context from these different connections in order to better do its job, but it doesn't have a similar connection to the n8n instance.\n\nSo what we need to do is find a way to get n8n into that ecosystem, so that's just another... whether that's by setting up tools in an MCP server, or if there's a way where we can deploy an installation of n8n, I don't know. But yeah. Okay, I think I'm pretty happy with how all that turned out. I'm going to leave it at that for now, and probably update later. Should have a pretty good update today.",

    "content": "# Building Drum Note: AI-Powered Drum Transcription, Kit Generation, and Hands-On Marketing with Render.com\n\n## Drum Note App Concept\nDrum Note is an AI-driven tool designed to bridge audio analysis and music creation for drummers and producers. Its core functionality revolves around bidirectional generation: converting drum and percussion audio samples into editable notation, and regenerating audio beats from that notation.\n\n### Key Features\n- **Audio-to-Notation Translation**: Upload sound files (e.g., music tracks or loops) to automatically generate drum sheet music. Supports complex rhythms like those in jungle drum and bass, extreme metal blast beats, or creative hip-hop patterns.\n- **Notation Editing and Regeneration**: Edit the transcribed notation in an intuitive interface, then use AI models to output new audio variations—enabling rapid iteration on beats.\n- **Granular Drum Kit Extraction**: Beyond basic stem separation (vocals, drums, etc.), Drum Note isolates individual kit components such as kick drum, snare, hi-hat, toms, ride, and crash cymbals. This creates reusable, high-fidelity samples for production.\n- **Future Expansions**: Potential integration for building custom kits from extracted sounds, with options for pitching, timing adjustments, and export to MIDI, MusicXML, or sheet music.\n\nThis tool targets the gap in current AI music workflows: while stem separation is mature (e.g., via models like OpenVINO), granular drum component isolation remains underdeveloped, making it ideal for acoustic drummers learning electronic styles or producers remixing breaks like the Amen break.\n\n## Inspiration from Star Power Drummer\nThe idea for Drum Note stems from observing real-world workflows in drum transcription. Star Power Drummer (@starpowerdrummer on YouTube), a classically trained jazz drummer and member of the rock-pop band Star Power, specializes in notating complex electronic genres. He manually transcribes jungle drum and bass tracks—known for their chopped, pitched Amen break variations—using tablet-based notation apps during travel downtime.\n\n- **Process He Follows**: Listens to a bar, pauses, rewinds, and notates elements like multi-pitched snares or unconventional hi-hats. He then assembles virtual kits to practice these \"impossible\" beats acoustically.\n- **Drum Note's Automation**: This app automates the entire pipeline—analysis, notation, kit building, and generation—to save hours and enable experimentation across genres like jungle, metal, hip-hop, and rock.\n\nBy automating this, Drum Note empowers users to focus on creativity rather than tedious transcription.\n\n## Marketing and Validation Strategy\nTo validate Drum Note, I'm building a simple static landing page on Render.com. The page will serve as a lead magnet: capturing emails, tracking visits, and funneling traffic to social channels or a project blog.\n\n### Goals\n- **Market Sizing**: Assess total addressable market (global drummers/producers), serviceable market (those reachable via digital channels), and practical market (early adopters in AI music communities).\n- **User Feedback**: Survey interest in features like kit extraction or genre-specific notations; identify communities (e.g., jungle enthusiasts, metal producers).\n- **Hands-On Learning**: Experiment with marketing tactics—lead capture forms, sales funnels, CTAs, A/B testing—using free online resources. This builds expertise without formal courses, turning self-marketing into a dual win: free promotion for Drum Note and skills for future opportunities.\n\nNo hires from marketing firms yet? No problem—apply concepts directly and leverage LLM-baked knowledge from public content.\n\n## Render.com: A Powerful Deployment Platform\nRender.com emerged as the deployment choice after a recommendation from a lead capture contact. It combines the speed of Vercel with Supabase-like backend services, making it ideal for rapid prototyping.\n\n### Standout Features\n- **Static and Full-Stack Deployment**: Push Jamstack apps (e.g., Next.js) via GitHub for automated CI/CD—no GitHub Actions required.\n- **Backend Services**: Managed Postgres databases, Redis-compatible key-value stores, and Cron tasks for scheduled jobs.\n- **AI Integration via MCP Servers**: Render's Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers allow direct infrastructure management from agentic tools like Cursor (my primary IDE) or Claude. Pull metrics, deploy updates, or analyze services—all within the AI workflow. This is a game-changer for developer productivity, especially in 2025's agentic coding era.\n\nNext steps: Deep dive into MCP for Cursor to enhance value for my network of devs and producers.\n\n## How This Content Can Help Others\n- **Drummers and Producers**: Discover tools for transcribing complex beats (e.g., jungle or metal) without manual notation—streamline learning acoustic versions of electronic rhythms or remix loops efficiently.\n- **AI Music Developers**: Gain insights into unmet needs like granular drum stem separation; prototype similar apps using Render for quick deploys and Cursor for AI-assisted coding.\n- **Aspiring Marketers**: Learn bootstrapped validation tactics—build landing pages to test ideas, capture leads, and iterate on funnels—without budgets or hires.\n- **Indie Devs**: Explore Render.com's MCP for seamless AI-tool integration, accelerating solo projects in music tech or beyond.\n\n## Validating the Vision: Establishing Authority in AI Music Tools and Agentic Development\nDrum Note addresses a clear market gap in 2025's AI music landscape. Existing tools like Klangio's Drum2Notes 6 and Drumscrib 13 excel at basic audio-to-notation transcription (e.g., from YouTube links to sheet music), but lack bidirectional generation or fine-grained kit isolation. Advanced stem separators like ReStem 15 and Music.ai's Drum Stems 16 isolate components (kick, snare, etc.), yet integration with editable notation remains fragmented—proving Drum Note's unique value for genres like jungle drum and bass.\n\nThis aligns with trends: YouTube creators like Star Power Drummer (@starpowerdrummer) 1 routinely demonstrate manual transcription of high-BPM jungle tracks (e.g., \"rizla\" by DJ Kuroneko) 0, highlighting demand for automation. As a developer with hands-on experience in AI workflows (Grok for ideation, GPT/Claude for code, Cursor for execution), I position Drum Note as a practical evolution—leveraging mature models like those in OpenVINO for viable, real-time analysis.\n\nOn deployment, Render.com's MCP servers 2022—generally available since August 2025—enable agentic control (e.g., metric pulls in Cursor) 28, outpacing Vercel/Supabase silos. This isn't hype; it's substantiated by Render's HTTP-streamable protocol for LLMs 22, making me a go-to voice for music-tech builders seeking scalable, AI-native stacks.\n\n## Cleaned Raw Transcript\nOkay, once again, I'm just freestyling. I don't know what the hell I'm going to talk about. So I'll just start listing off some of the things that I got going on. Last night, the last thing that I did was look at Render.com finally. This is actually maybe shaping up to be a pretty interesting tool. I also did—I know what I'll talk about: Drum Note. Because in order to do my first static page on Render, the concept that I came up with is—I didn't really make anything fictional up, actually. I've got so many ideas and there's so many things that I want to actually do and learn and equip myself to achieve that I just used the real stuff that I'm really trying to do as my first example. So I started planning a static site, which is going to be a landing page. The purpose of the landing page is to gauge interest in an app that I call Drum Note, which is—its purpose is to take samples of audio from sound files and analyze them. Basically, just a one-liner: take the drums and percussion from music and translate it into notation and give you the ability to edit notation and then regenerate a new beat. So, okay, I'm going to work this out a little bit because I want to get the one-liner, because that's probably going to be the tagline of the whole landing site. Yeah, something like: translate—generate notation from sound, generate sound from notation. Compose sound from notation. I actually don't know that I like \"compose.\" I think \"generate.\" I need to really find a way to drive home \"generate\" because it's the AI functionality that's really going to sell it. Whatever models that I need to use in order to generate the notation from the sound and the sound from the notation. And then also just to kind of expand on that core functionality, what it also does is it takes—during the analysis of the sound file, or maybe it may be a second stage or something. I don't know. We'll see when I get to playing around with it, what works best. But you also want to take and generate a kit. So you want to get the drum and percussion sound and split it apart. So you want to split the—and this is something that I don't think that I see. Everybody has stem separation. That appears to have been cracked to a substantial degree to a viable degree, and a lot of people use it. It's actually become a fairly well fine-tuned model, whatever it is that they're using, OpenVINO and all that. But so that project is well underway. What I'm not seeing is like a granular generation of the different components of the drum kit, right? So just the most basic, the most basic viable rip would be kick drum, snare drum, cymbal. Separate those out cleanly enough to be usable. And that's a pretty viable model. Also, another sort of related project is separating music vocal and effect stems from movies, particularly the effects. That's one thing that you're not seeing a lot of. So I can rip vocals out of music if there's no effects going on, but I can't rip effects out from music or vocal, right? So that becomes a shit show, kind of. But that's not within the scope of this talk. What I want to talk about is Drum Note. So I started chatting with an LLM. I think it was Grok for now. And then when I get into more technical, like wanting real code snippets and technology instructions, I might—I'll probably move the conversation to some prompts that I have for GPT and Claude, particularly for the code. But by that point, a lot of times I'm already in Cursor and I let Cursor handle which model to use from there on out. That seems to work pretty well. So yeah, so it's just a landing page. The purpose of the landing page is to gauge interest in Drum Note. And hit pause for now, and I'll be right back. Right, so the purpose of the landing site is to—what was last seen? Okay, so it's to gauge interest in Drum Note. So I want to get an idea of who's interested in it, how many people it is, what kind of communities it is, what kind of functionality, what kind of additional functionality they might be interested in. Yeah, I want to figure out what my market looks like, and I already forgot all the marketing terms. I want to say, like addressable market or like the total possible. There's like the total addressable market. There's the serviceable market. And then there's the—basically. There's who all could possibly use this globally. And then there's like who can we realistically expect to service and then like who do we have the ability to actually serve? Like, what is theoretically possible? What is theoretically probable and what is actually practically reasonable? Yeah, that's it. That's essentially it. What's theoretically possible? What is realistically probable? Yeah, no, reasonably probable is a good term. What is theoretically possible, what is reasonably probable, and what is realistically practical? Like achievable. So yeah, those kind of things. Okay, whatever, man. We just got to—okay, just—sorry, drive, talk, drive, talk. Yeah, so I want to get—I want to capture emails. I want to capture visit data and I want to funnel people, like, so I want to funnel people to my email. I want to funnel people to social, and then maybe even start blogging about it, start a blog. And you know, I just want to get really—a part of what this is is just getting my feet wet in terms of marketing. Like, getting hands-on with some of these concepts, like lead capture, sales funnels, call to actions, A/B testing. I want to get familiar with these concepts, and so I want to do it by getting real hands-on, real-world experience. And if I'm not getting hired by marketing firms, then I'll market my own ideas and see how it goes. And then I'll use online resources. Because one thing's for sure, I'm just not doing a good job of marketing myself to marketing people or it may just not be a good fit. But they're doing stuff and they're creating content and they're sharing all this wisdom and information freely and then, of course, it's getting baked into the training of powerful LLMs that I depend on. So if I want to learn marketing, I can learn marketing. There's plenty of resources out there in terms of content that's being created by marketing firms. And so yeah, and so I can study the—I don't have to like take a course on it. I can create my own course and do well and learn the things. So why not just apply that to my own product? Two things are going to happen, and who knows which one is going to be the more significant. I'm going to gain the experience that will make me valuable to marketing firms, and I'm going to get free marketing services for my ideas. So I can't lose. So let's talk more about what—both of these. Okay, this is actually two topics in one, but both of them are important, and they are pretty closely related. There's the marketing conversation, like the strategies, the tools, everything involved in the concepts, the terminology, all the things involved in like marketing. And then there's also the topic of the app itself, the Drum Note app. So I'm just going to kind of balance back and forth between the two. Let's talk about some of the features and functionality of Drum Note, because that's actually going to tell me a lot about the community that I might be servicing and what my potential market might be. So what does it do? Okay. So well, let's just talk about like a little bit of history, where—how the idea emerged. Okay. So I'm just going to name-drop the Star Power Drummer. And that's actually what he calls himself on YouTube, because he creates drum-related content. So what this guy does, he's a drummer in kind of a rock-pop band called Star Power. And he's a classically trained jazz drummer. And so he knows academically all about notation and, you know, all the technical concepts with music. So he knows how to read and write music and he knows how to notate drums. And he's also a fan of jungle drum and bass electronic dance music. So jungle music has some of the most complex and interesting beats because they pretty much just take the Amen break and like chop it up, speed it up, slow it down, pitch it up and down, and like program these really complex and interesting, impossible drum beats. And what Star Power Drummer does is, you know, they travel a lot in the band, so he's oftentimes on a plane for hours, and one of the things that he does to kill the time is he's got a tablet that has—and this is where I need to do some kind of research on what's actually out there. Because he uses an app that does notation. And this app may have actually started playing around with this functionality. If not, they're stupid. I think. I don't know. That's what the whole market analysis thing is for. But yeah, so basically what he does is he listens to jungle music and he writes the notation down in just a simple, like a simple music notation app that he has on a tablet. So he'll listen to it and then he'll pause it, back it up, listen to it, like a bar of music at a time and just kind of like notate. And some of this music is so complex, you have to kind of like invent a key for everything, what represents each thing. Some of it's pretty standard stuff, like a snare or a kick or a high hat or whatever, you know, some of it's got pretty traditional notation, but—he's, you know, it's jungle music, so you don't simply have a snare. You've got a snare with various pitches. And what he'll actually do is get multiple snares and key them in a way where they are pitched to a certain note, and he'll—so essentially what he does is he notates jungle music in sheet music, and then he assembles a drum kit and he learns how to play jungle music acoustically. I would also apply this to extreme metal music and like blast beats and some of the elaborate fills and some of the more creative and trippy hip hop and rock music does things like this. Okay. Damn, man, that's all I got time for. But I feel like yeah, I feel like I should pick this back up maybe later today. Yeah. That kind of sucks. Okay, looks like I may have a minute to kind of wrap this up or at least get it to a sufficient amount of content to publish. So yeah, I think I was talking about Star Power Drummer and the way he creates notation. So yeah, I essentially want to automate this process. That's really all this is, is automating the process of how a Star Power Drummer notates jungle drum and bass breaks so that he can assemble them acoustically. Really, I just—I want to automate every part of that process. Like, forwards and backwards. So listening and listening to and analyzing interesting beats and then translating that into notation and then taking that notation and building a kit and then and then just generating new beats from that notation. So essentially, that's what this is. It's just an automated—it's a way of doing it in software. So yeah, I guess I was pretty much at a good place there. And then other tools will come online, like the ability to—the ability to edit the notation and the ability to, you know, like I said, build a kit. And that's a pretty solid—I don't want to overthink it. I really want to keep it simple enough to pop out quickly and be viable. Now, okay. Okay, so going back to the Render.com stuff, because I think that's also an important component of this topic. So it was recently brought to my attention by a person, a contact of mine in lead capture, how powerful this platform is. So I'm just going to kind of talk about what I've learned about it so far, what I foresee being able to do with this problem that I've outlined to use Render.com as a potential solution there. So Render.com is pretty interesting. It's kind of in the class of products like Supabase, kind of, and Vercel, kind of, but it's—it's also kind of its own thing. It's, you know, like Vercel, it can take a Jamstack, like a Next.js app, and it can deploy and it can deploy rapidly. And it can connect to GitHub. Actually, the more I think about it, the more badass Render is because it's taken the best of Vercel and it's taken the best of Supabase and it's kind of combining them. So you can—you can connect your GitHub repo to Render so that it has automated CI. So it'll just pull the repo down and deploy it. No GitHub action needed. No, we're not going there. Sorry, sometimes I talk to my dog. You can just ignore that when I'm walking the dog. So yeah, you can deploy a Jamstack as a static site, but it's also got a lot of more Supabase-like things, like a Postgres database, like it's not really Redis. It says Redis-compatible key-value store. So and it also mentions something about being able to—being able to handle, well, let me just—before I drill down into the specifics of each feature, it's like they've got a static site deployment. They've got a full-stack deployment. And I can't remember if it said anything about functions, but if it's got a full-stack deployment, then that's essentially serverless functions. Just like a more robust API kind of thing. Yeah, I said the Postgres, what else? What am I dancing around? Oh, Cron tasks. It's got Cron tasks. What I really want to jump to, though, is what interested me the most. They've got a new feature. It may not be brand new, but they're really, really hyping their MCP servers. And they're specifically saying that they're designed for integration with Cursor. So that's—that's really interesting because that's my go-to IDE, especially for an agentic co-pilot. So yeah, that's cool. I need to do a deep dive into that. That's what I'm going to make that an objective for today is to do a deep dive into Render's MCP servers. I think that's where I'm going to end up bringing a lot of value for some of the people in my network that use this solution. Being able to—yeah, yeah, being able to hook up, being able to just see what the capabilities of their MCP server functionality is, what it looks like and how I can leverage that to be more valuable.",

    "content": "# Exploring No-Code Development with Replit: A Professional Analysis\n\nRecently, I experimented with Replit to develop a simple to-do application, leveraging its no-code capabilities to understand its potential for founders and developers. This article provides a structured analysis of the Replit experience, the strategic implications of no-code platforms, and considerations for integrating them into professional development workflows.\n\n## Replit’s No-Code Development Process\n\nUsing Replit, I created a to-do application with a prompt generated by Grok to ensure simplicity. The platform’s agent autonomously handled the entire development lifecycle—writing TypeScript files, installing NPM dependencies, executing build commands, deploying Docker containers for the backend, and migrating a database. My role was limited to providing the initial prompt, reviewing the plan, and approving execution, all within a browser-based interface.\n\nKey observations include:\n- **Automation and Reliability**: The application was deployed without errors, suggesting Replit runs tests and corrects issues automatically.\n- **Mobile Accessibility**: Replit’s mobile application replicates the web platform’s functionality, enabling app creation and deployment from a smartphone for approximately $20 per month.\n- **Non-Technical Interface**: No integrated development environment (IDE) or command-line access was required, making the process accessible to non-coders.\n\nThis experience underscores Replit’s ability to streamline development for users with minimal technical expertise.\n\n## Objectives of the Experiment\n\nThe experiment aimed to address several professional objectives:\n1. **Understanding Founder Capabilities**: Assessing what non-technical founders can achieve with no-code platforms to better align development services with their needs.\n2. **Preventing Overpromising**: Ensuring developers do not overstate the value of custom solutions when no-code alternatives can deliver similar outcomes faster and at lower costs.\n3. **Enhancing Developer Productivity**: Exploring how no-code tools can complement traditional coding skills, improving efficiency without replacing expertise.\n4. **Evaluating User Experience**: Gaining insight into the founder experience to anticipate challenges and tailor solutions effectively.\n\nThese objectives reflect the need to balance technical expertise with the growing accessibility of no-code platforms.\n\n## Avoiding Overcomplication in Development\n\nA common challenge in software development is the tendency to overcomplicate solutions. Historically, developers resisted frameworks like React, preferring custom solutions or vanilla JavaScript for perceived flexibility. However, this often stems from a desire to demonstrate skill rather than strategic necessity.\n\n- **Complexity vs. Complication**: Purposeful complexity delivers measurable advantages, such as scalability or performance. Unjustified complexity, however, creates confusion without adding value.\n- **Parallels with No-Code**: Dismissing no-code platforms due to a preference for manual coding mirrors past resistance to frameworks. While custom development has its place, rejecting no-code tools without evaluation is shortsighted.\n- **Strategic Adoption**: Developers should adopt no-code platforms for tasks they excel at, reserving custom coding for scenarios requiring specialized expertise.\n\nThis perspective encourages a pragmatic approach to tool adoption, prioritizing business outcomes over personal preferences.\n\n## Cost Efficiency: No-Code vs. Traditional Development\n\nNo-code platforms like Replit offer significant cost advantages. Consider the following analogy:\n- **No-Code as Routine Maintenance**: Simple tasks, akin to routine maintenance, can be handled by no-code platforms at a low cost (e.g., $20 per hour equivalent).\n- **Traditional Development as Specialized Work**: Complex tasks requiring custom solutions justify the higher cost of professional developers (e.g., $100 per hour equivalent).\n\nFor routine features, no-code platforms are cost-effective, while specialized tasks demand professional expertise. Strategically allocating tasks between these approaches optimizes resources.\n\n### Constraints and Strategic Considerations\n\nWhile Replit offers compelling advantages, it also presents constraints:\n- **Limited Customization**: Users cannot directly edit code, relying on the agent to implement changes. Interface elements, such as a “run” button executing NPM commands, simplify interaction but restrict control.\n- **Platform Lock-In**: Replit provides cloud services like storage buckets and PostgreSQL databases. However, migrating to self-managed infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) may be complex if a project outgrows the platform.\n- **Evolving Ecosystem**: Like Firebase, Replit is rapidly improving, potentially reducing the need for custom infrastructure. This evolution complicates long-term planning, as reliance on no-code platforms may delay or eliminate the need for solutions like Kubernetes or Terraform.\n\nThese considerations highlight the importance of evaluating lock-in risks and planning for scalability.\n\n## Proposing a Hybrid Development Workflow\n\nTo balance no-code and traditional development, a hybrid workflow could be implemented:\n- **No-Code for Simple Tasks**: Use Replit for straightforward features, leveraging its speed and accessibility.\n- **Traditional Development for Complex Tasks**: Employ professional developers with IDEs and custom pipelines for advanced requirements.\n- **Integrated Workflow via GitHub**: A potential solution involves GitHub Actions:\n  1. Founders create issue tickets describing tasks in plain language.\n  2. A webhook triggers an AI agent (e.g., using LangChain in a cloud function) to analyze the codebase, create a branch, generate changes, run tests, and open a pull request.\n  3. Developers review and merge the pull request, triggering deployment.\n\nThis approach enables founders to contribute via no-code interfaces while allowing developers to handle complex engineering, minimizing conflicts between workflows.\n\n## Strategic Questions for Adoption\n\nThe experiment raised critical questions for developers and founders:\n- **Lock-In Risks**: What is the extent of Replit’s lock-in, and how feasible is migration to custom infrastructure?\n- **Workflow Integration**: Can Replit coexist with traditional development pipelines, or is a full transition to AI-assisted coding required for advanced projects?\n- **Platform Evolution**: Will no-code platforms render custom infrastructure obsolete for most startups?\n- **AI-Assisted Tools**: Are there IDE-integrated AI agents that replicate Replit’s automation for professional developers?\n\nAddressing these questions will guide strategic decisions about adopting no-code platforms.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nReplit’s no-code capabilities empower founders to build functional applications quickly and affordably, while challenging developers to rethink traditional approaches. By strategically leveraging no-code platforms for routine tasks and reserving custom development for complex needs, organizations can optimize efficiency and scalability. As no-code ecosystems evolve, developers must remain open to AI-driven tools, integrating them thoughtfully to enhance productivity. Future exploration will focus on AI-assisted development tools for professional engineers, ensuring alignment with founder needs and industry trends.",

    "content": "# The Last Cycle: Why Founder-Engineer Partnerships Are Nearing Their End\n\n## The Final Cycle of Founder-Engineer Collaboration\n \nI believe we’re approaching the end of an era—potentially the last cycle where I, as an engineer, partner with founders to build their products while they fund the development. My intuition suggests this shift could happen within the next six months to three years, though exceptions will always exist. We’ve entered a phase where relying on large teams and big budgets is becoming unwise. Instead, the future favors small, agile teams—sometimes as small as one founder and one engineer, both leveraging AI tools to maximize efficiency.\n\nThis cycle is defined by a transition to minimal teams. A single, capable engineer with a strong software development background can now use emerging AI tools to achieve what once required entire teams. The current iteration of this cycle likely began in the past three to six months, marked by the maturation of tools like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Grok 3—IDEs and LLMs natively built for coding tasks such as code prediction and automation.\n\n### Timeline of the Current Cycle\n- **Previous Cycle**: Likely spanned from the release of ChatGPT to the emergence of AI-native IDEs like Cursor.\n- **Current Cycle**: Began within the last three to six months, driven by advanced AI tools.\n- **Duration**: Unlike past cycles that lasted years, this one may only last months—potentially ending within a year.\n\nBy the end of this year, or at most within one to three years, we’ll likely enter a new era where most companies no longer hire engineers. Founders who continue to rely on hiring engineers risk financial strain, as they’ll spend heavily while competitors leverage AI to build faster and cheaper.\n\n## Strategic Plan for the Next 6–12 Months\n\nTo make the most of this final cycle, I’m focusing on partnering with the right founders—those at the right stage, with the right mentality, and aligned with my vision. I aim to secure three to five high-quality clients to maximize the next six to twelve months. These partnerships will be intense, collaborative efforts to build products using AI tools to accelerate development.\n\n### Current Workflow\n- **Build and Document**: I develop the product, write comprehensive documentation, and train my replacement.\n- **Hand-Off**: I transition the project to a team of developers—often more cost-effective—for long-term maintenance while I remain available for consultations.\n- **Continuous Lead Generation**: Historically, I’ve always sought new leads to start fresh projects, keeping my rates high by handing off completed projects and moving to the next challenge.\n\nHowever, this cycle demands a shift. Rather than seeking new leads to replace these clients after hand-off, I plan to redirect that time and energy into my own ideas—building my own companies, products, and tools. This is critical because engineers who don’t pivot to founding their own ventures risk obsolescence as AI tools mature and reduce the need for hired technical talent.\n\n## The Future of Engineering and Founding\n\nWithin a year, founders who rely on engineers to build their products will struggle to compete. They’ll hemorrhage money on salaries while competitors use AI to move faster. Similarly, engineers who don’t found their own companies or build their own products will face diminishing opportunities. AI tools are rapidly approaching a point where they can handle most development tasks, making traditional engineering roles less essential.\n\n### Risks for Stakeholders\n- **Founders**: Spending heavily on engineers will slow them down, as competitors leverage AI for cost-effective, rapid development.\n- **Engineers**: Those who don’t pivot to founding or building their own products risk unemployment as AI tools replace their roles.\n\nThis isn’t imminent enough to halt all action, but it’s close enough to demand preparation. A year is both a lifetime and a blink in tech. The solution is to act now—build, adapt, and embrace the tools. Waiting for AI to fully mature will leave you lagging behind those who’ve been iterating all along.\n\n## The Ideal Engineer for This Cycle\n\nFor founders, the key is to partner with a specific type of engineer—one who can navigate this transitional period effectively. This engineer should combine deep expertise with broad familiarity, embracing AI tools to stay competitive.\n\n### Qualities of the Ideal Engineer\n- **Diverse Experience**: Familiarity with cloud, backend, frontend, and various software development methodologies.\n- **Deep Expertise**: Extensive experience in at least one area, understanding scalability, security, and maintainable code.\n- **Startup Background**: Experience working with startups, juggling multiple roles, and adapting to fast-paced environments.\n- **AI Adoption**: Open-mindedness and proficiency in using AI tools like LLMs, code prediction, and automation.\n- **Collaborative Mindset**: Willingness to provide feedback, refine AI-generated code, and work closely with founders to prototype and iterate.\n\nFounders should go all-in on this person, learning as much as possible about their processes. If the engineer has blind spots—say, in design—founders can use AI-driven design tools to prototype and hand off assets. The engineer, in turn, must be open to feedback, refining AI-generated outputs (e.g., React code from LLMs) and helping founders improve their prompts. This collaboration maximizes efficiency and prepares founders for a future where they may rely less on human engineers.\n\n## Advice for Engineers: Build Your Own Future\n\nTo my fellow developers: the time to act is now. Every idea you’ve dismissed as too risky, too niche, or likely to fail—build it. The experience of creating, shipping, and iterating is invaluable, even if the product doesn’t succeed. Build tools you’d use yourself, things you believe should exist. Use them, improve them, and make them valuable to others.\n\n### Why Build Now?\n- **Experience**: Shipping a product, adding analytics, engaging users, and gathering feedback is inherently worthwhile.\n- **Market Relevance**: Tools you find useful are likely valuable to others, creating opportunities for impact.\n- **Future-Proofing**: Building your own products positions you as a founder, not just a hired engineer, in a world where AI reduces traditional roles.\n\nDon’t let fear of failure or competition stop you. Most ideas will fail, but the process of building hones your skills and prepares you for the one that succeeds. The alternative—waiting for the market to stabilize—means falling behind.\n\n## The Role of Novelty in the AI Era\n\nAs AI tools commoditize technical skills, novelty and creativity will become the primary assets for both founders and engineers. Large companies like xAI, Google, and Microsoft will dominate with their vast data and computational resources, but individual creativity can still carve out a niche.\n\n### Harnessing Creativity\n- **Amplify Uniqueness**: Focus on what makes your ideas different—your unique perspective is your competitive edge.\n- **Generate Novelty**: Create products, tools, or solutions that stand out in a crowded market.\n- **Internal Potential**: Each of us has the capacity to generate endless novelty, akin to a “universe” of ideas waiting to be explored.\n\nThis aligns with the concept of an AI singularity—a point where technology reshapes everything. I liken it to reaching escape velocity through a black hole, emerging into a new universe of possibilities. Every individual has the potential to create their own “Big Bang” of innovation, driving a new wave of value creation.\n\n## Metaphorical Vision: The Rocket to Escape Velocity\n\nWe’re on a speeding bullet train to a launch pad, where a rocket is fueling up for takeoff. This rocket represents the rapid advancement of AI, propelling us toward a future where dependency on human engineers diminishes. We’re approaching escape velocity—a point where most software development tasks can be handled by AI, enabling founders to ship and maintain products without traditional engineering support.\n\nThis isn’t a reason to wait—it’s a call to action. Partner with the right people, embrace the tools, and build relentlessly. Those who wait for AI to “arrive” will be outpaced by those who’ve been leveraging it all along. For engineers, this means founding your own ventures and creating novel solutions. For founders, it means learning from your technical partners and preparing to navigate a future where AI is your primary tool.",

    "content": "# Revenant Hollow: Integrating Technology into Location-Based Horror Experiences\n\n## Overview\nRevenant Hollow is an interactive, location-based entertainment experience primarily focused on the horror genre, targeting seasonal Halloween markets such as haunted houses and scare attractions. It incorporates advanced technologies to enhance theatrical, story-based attractions, blending mixed reality (virtual and augmented reality), automation, robotics, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The goal is to create immersive, interactive environments where technology elevates traditional scare props and visitor engagement.\n\n## Key Technological Components\n### Mixed Reality Integration\n- **Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)**: Central to the experience, allowing for overlaid digital elements in physical spaces. Early experiments used first-generation devices like Oculus and Vive, with Pokémon GO as a benchmark for consumer AR. Since then, advancements in hardware (e.g., improved Oculus devices) and software ecosystems have revolutionized the field, incorporating AI for more sophisticated interactions.\n- **Mobile Device Utilization**: Visitors' smartphones become integral to the experience, leveraging built-in features like lights, sound, haptics (vibration), geolocation, and cameras. This extends beyond basic apps to real-time interaction with the environment, unlocking functionalities like personalized scares or location-triggered events.\n\n### IoT and Automation\n- **Scare Props and Mechanical Elements**: Traditional elements like lights, speakers, and servo motors (e.g., repurposed animatronics) are enhanced with IoT connectivity. This allows for synchronized, responsive behaviors in props, such as jump scares triggered by visitor proximity.\n- **Node-Based Infrastructure**: Facade walls and structures incorporate standardized \"nodes\" equipped with devices like Raspberry Pi or Arduino for control, network repeaters, and sensors. Initially planned with wired electricity and data infrastructure (including conduits for power, networking, and speakers), the design has evolved to prioritize batteries, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth due to modern advancements in battery life and wireless tech. For pneumatics, a centralized compressor handles air distribution to minimize wiring.\n\n### Broader Strategic Vision\nRevenant Hollow serves as a foundational project for developing expertise in connecting mixed reality with location-based entertainment. It addresses challenges in theatrical attractions, building software and hardware capabilities that can scale to non-seasonal applications. The long-term objective is the Augmented Reality Sports Complex—a permanent facility for interactive, recreational activities that appeal to a wide audience. Key features include:\n- Synchronization across locations for hybrid in-person and remote interactions.\n- Standardized architecture to enable consistent experiences worldwide.\n- Revival of social, location-based entertainment, countering the shift to isolated online gaming by blending physical meetups with digital enhancements.\n\n## Development History\nInitiated pre-COVID (around 2019), the project involved extensive planning, design, and rudimentary R&D, including lab-based proofs of concept. COVID and rapid tech evolution paused progress, rendering early prototypes obsolete. However, the core designs remain relevant, adapted to current leaps in AI, hardware, and wireless technologies.\n\n## Suggested Uses for This Content\nThis post could be valuable for:\n- **Entrepreneurs in Entertainment Tech**: Insights into integrating AR/VR and IoT into haunted attractions or similar venues, providing a blueprint for low-barrier seasonal startups on farms or temporary sites.\n- **Developers and Engineers**: Practical ideas on node-based systems, shifting from wired to wireless infrastructure, and leveraging consumer devices for immersive experiences—useful for prototyping in mixed reality or IoT projects.\n- **Event Planners and Theater Professionals**: Guidance on blending theatrical elements (e.g., props, wardrobe, acting) with technology to create engaging, story-driven attractions.\n- **Investors or Researchers in Location-Based Entertainment**: Overview of market evolution from arcades to modern AR complexes, highlighting opportunities in reviving in-person social gaming amid post-COVID recovery.\n- **Parents or Educators**: Reflections on balancing online and physical activities for youth, inspiring initiatives to encourage community meetups through tech-enhanced recreation.\n\n## Validation of Perspective and Authority\nAs someone with years of hands-on experience in early mixed reality development—dating back to the first-generation Oculus and Vive era—I have witnessed and adapted to pivotal shifts in the field, including the rise of AI-driven enhancements and consumer adoption post-Pokémon GO. My background spans R&D in IoT-integrated entertainment, with direct involvement in designing scalable systems for theatrical attractions. This positions me as an expert in bridging traditional location-based entertainment (e.g., haunted houses, arcades) with cutting-edge tech, informed by observations of generational changes in gaming from the late 1980s/early 1990s arcades to today's online dominance. Industry parallels, such as Microsoft's experimental mixed reality and Magic Leap's high-end applications, align with my designs, while post-COVID trends toward hybrid experiences validate the need for initiatives like the Augmented Reality Sports Complex. My strategic approach—starting with genre-specific, seasonal projects to build toward permanent facilities—mirrors successful tech incubation models, establishing credibility in the immersive entertainment community.\n\n## Cleaned Transcript\nI want to talk about Revenant Hollow from a technological standpoint because it always means something to me. I don't know what happened in my previous articles on this, because I know I've talked about this a lot. Maybe I just never published anything. But if so, that ends today. So I guess I better start from the beginning. What is Revenant Hollow? No, let me start with almost a tagline, just real short and sweet. What it is, what it does. It's a location-based experience. So it's an interactive location-based entertainment experience, initially focused on the horror genre, the seasonal Halloween market, haunted houses, scare attractions, thriller type stuff. And it's a way to incorporate technology into location-based entertainment experiences, particularly the more theatrical story-based attractions, like a Halloween haunted scare house, jump scare, thriller kind of attraction.\n\nSo what all are we doing here? In a high level, just broad, general technological view of what technologies this experience involves: virtual reality, augmented reality are important components; automation, robotics, Internet of Things. So it's a way to connect mixed reality software solutions, and the fact that it's location-based means that we can use IoT devices and anything that's mechanical in scare props—there could be an IoT component there. There will be. In fact, I've actually developed this a lot. I've spent several years, but I've spent a lot of time planning and designing and to some degree doing research and development, although extremely rudimentary proof of concept—more like labs than a true proof of concept. Some of them actually got mature, but it doesn't matter. It's ancient history. What matters is the design and the objective and the plan because it's been so long that everything that I might have developed has gone stale. And every bit of technology that I was developing with has had multiple leapfrog moments. Virtual reality, in particular, has a whole new era, really.\n\nWhen I was experimenting with virtual and augmented reality, the solutions that I was experimenting with and the technologies, the frameworks, the languages, the libraries, everything in the ecosystem of mixed reality at that time was like early first-generation Oculus, first-generation Vive—that whole era. That's when that was. So when you talk about mixed reality, the only thing people knew about was Pokémon GO, which was probably the most sophisticated, mass-adopted, mainstream pop culture breakthrough product. The flagship of anything that you could consider mixed reality was something like that, at least consumer-facing. There's probably a lot of really high-end business-facing, like Magic Leap, I think is what it was called. And, of course, Microsoft always had experimental mixed reality technologies. But yeah, that's where we were. And so much has happened since then. This was pre-COVID. COVID is to a large degree what knocked me out of the game with what I was working on, and many other things.\n\nBut okay, so yeah, there's the mixed reality component. What all advantages have been made in that space? Not just in terms of software. You've got to think what else has changed over the past—we're talking 2019, I think. So you've got to think what all has changed. It's not just the software. It's hardware devices, and it's artificial intelligence. And one notable breakthrough technology is what Oculus has been working on, because this is a consumer-facing platform. So it's really important what devices people know about and adopt. But I don't want to go too far down this. I want to keep it high level. Maybe even talk about some of the history.\n\nSo there's a mixed reality component where people's phones become a part of the experience, like become an integral part of the experience, and it's not just like we have a website and we have an app and we have a login where you can buy tickets or something. No, it's like actually a part of the interactive experience. Your phone is—you've got to think, well, let's back up a little, and let's talk about scare props in a haunted attraction, right? So you've got lights, speakers, you've got little servo motors like some Christmas deer motors that are often repurposed for zombies or whatever you can imagine.\n\nYeah, so that's a good start. That's a good basis. So you've got lights, and you've got sound, and you've got some amount of mechanical devices. And so your phone is all that in your pocket. Your phone has lights. It has sound, and it even has an additional component: haptics with its vibration ability. And then when you think about all the other technologies that you can tap into, if you can just begin to integrate its technological capabilities into experiences, then you suddenly start to realize that it unlocks all kinds of functionality. Geolocation for one. And then you plug that into IoT devices. So where a lot of these experiences fall short is the location-based context gives us a lot of ways we can cheat. We'll also have cameras—that's another important thing. So you get to have all these different parts.\n\nI had designed a specification for facade walls. A part of a good professional scare attraction is to be able to create facade walls. A lot of this stuff is so theatrical. That's one thing that's really exciting about it: if you have any interest in theater, whether that's as an actor or in wardrobe or building props, it's all valuable skills that are interconnected. So just a little side note there. But yeah, so each facade wall—there's similar frameworks behind every facade wall that you'll build. There's an underlying structure, and a part of that underlying structure, you can fit standardized technology. Really, think of it as nodes. And I think that's actually the terminology that I used: nodes. So every so often you'll have a node, and that node would have standard things that you'd expect, like a Raspberry Pi or an Arduino or some kind of network repeater.\n\nOne thing that I would certainly change about the initial plan with how I would do things now is I had always envisioned this as having electricity infrastructure, like running wiring to things, and not just electricity infrastructure. I went all in for: we're going to expect that we have conduits, and we're going to expect that we have wiring. We're just going to accept the fact that we're going to have wiring. So we're going to go ahead and run conduit, go ahead and run infrastructure. We can put electrical wires in the conduit, and that takes away the need for batteries because battery life and everything in that whole ecosystem just uses disposable batteries. All the consumer-grade products use disposable batteries. So I naturally was apprehensive about considering batteries at all. So I wanted to just run electricity infrastructure, and then I was like, well, this gives us an additional benefit because if we have electricity infrastructure, then we can run network infrastructure too. So with every conduit, we could run high-voltage and low-voltage wire. We could run power outlet wire and we could run data cabling and maybe even speaker wire, too.\n\nBut now I would absolutely call bullshit on that. I would say no, that's dumb, because batteries are so good now that we would plan each node to where it had a battery with the capacity to last whatever's practical—eight hours, something like that—to power all of the electronics. And there would be some cases where, if we had pneumatics, you're going to need to run a compressor. So you've got to be careful about those things, because you need to put your compressor somewhere. That actually makes a lot of sense, because all you would be doing is running air. You wouldn't be running power cables. You would have one big central compressor in a place that was well muffled, and you would just run air from that centralized location.\n\nBut yeah, so what I'm getting at is Wi-Fi advancements in battery and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It just seems silly now to run electricity infrastructure. That's one good example of how things would be different now.\n\nOkay, so let's talk about how this fits in with a broader scope, a long-term plan that ultimately results in what I call the Augmented Reality Sports Complex. So this is a seasonal thing. It's something you can throw together on a farm. It's something where you can work on advancements in software. The part of the objective strategically of the Revenant Hollow initiative is to develop software and expertise, to cultivate expertise and develop software and hardware that teaches us. Basically, we want to gain capabilities and resources in connecting mixed reality experiences with location-based entertainment, with interactive, theatrical-based entertainment attractions. And solving meaningful problems in that context gives us the ability to apply this to things that are non-seasonal, that are less genre-specific, ultimately establish a permanent facility where there's recreational, interactive recreational activities in location-based recreational activities that appeal to a broader audience—like, not everybody's into horror, and Halloween isn't all year.\n\nThe sports complex is a permanent facility that local people can travel to, meet up in person, but also interact with remote users in other parts of the world. And one of the important features and capabilities is syncing up, being able to standardize the architecture of the complex so that people can sync their experiences across locations. And I really feel like this is a huge, that this is a very valuable and important breakthrough to be able to do this, the idea of getting people out of the house again. And this is another reason why COVID derailed this whole initiative.\n\nI think that I've always thought, ever since my kids were babies, watching—I grew up at the tail end of the golden age of arcades, and I grew up in the era of shopping malls, shopping centers, movie theaters, arcades. There were still some pretty awesome arcades. It wasn't the golden age, like the '70s, late '70s, early '80s. I grew up late '80s, early '90s. So I never saw what they call the golden age of arcades. But I went to some pretty badass arcades, and I had a lot of fun for many years. Some of the most fond memories as a young child and a teenager are hanging out at arcades, even if it's just a little offshoot of a shopping mall, going to movie theaters—these kinds of location-based entertainment.\n\nAnd what happened was I saw this generation essentially consensually plugging into the Matrix, just staying at home. And look, we had consoles too. My generation was more of a balance of location-based experiences, like going out and meeting people in public places, and console gaming from the house. And it wasn't until I was a teenager that online gaming became really crucial. There were always people who would get online and play Doom and stuff, but it wasn't massive. You weren't beginning to see mass adoption online until like Diablo and probably Unreal Tournament was one of the biggest breakthroughs.\n\nAnd so then I kind of grew up and became an adult and had kids and didn't have as much time for games. And when I saw this whole online world take off, I'm like, nobody's getting out anymore. Everybody's just staying in their basement, connecting to the internet from home. And that's awesome. That's great. I would never say sacrifice that, because I was right there with Unreal Tournament. I was right there with the original Diablo. I saw the magic of online gaming as it emerged as something crucial. And it was magical. I will never deny that. But it took something away that a generation missed out on. And I want this next generation to know how badass it is for it to be normal that you'd hop on your bike or hit your ride or just drop in on some place where other kids meet up and just hang out all day, especially on a Saturday or every afternoon, and there's always snacks and games and movies, and gaming was always a serious component to that.\n\nSo that's where the Augmented Reality Sports Complex, the desire, the dream, emerges from: combining next-level networking and the resurgence of location-based entertainment. And what is the nexus? Actually, I should do one on Nexus Protocol Stack. That was interesting. But that's outside the scope of this discussion. Yeah, so what does that look like? That is my objective. And the first phase is Revenant Hollow, because it's seasonal, it's straightforward, it's genre-specific. It's something with enough constraints where we can make meaningful progress and then use the advancements, the research, the development as a stepping stone to move forward with the Augmented Reality Sports Complex initiative. And the standardization of architecture, the standardization of technology, hardware, and the software product ecosystem that will undoubtedly, inexorably, vis-à-vis, concordantly, ergo.",

    "content": "# The Jumpstarter: A 5-Point Framework to Align Value and Passion\n\n> *Or... How the alignment of what you desire with what makes you valuable can drastically increase productivity.*\n\n## Daily Stand-Up Report: A New Framework for Productivity and Honesty\n\nI’ve been working on a new format for my daily stand-up report, something to structure my thoughts and capture ideas during downtime—like when I’m driving or walking the dog. It’s a five-point framework I’m calling **Action, Progress, Challenge, Intuition, and Strategy**. I might tweak the names later, but for now, this is the gist: **What did you do? How’s it going? What’s the biggest challenge? What do you want? What are you going to do?** Here’s how it breaks down.\n\n### The Five-Point Framework\n1. **Action**: What did you do yesterday? Specifically, what technologies, methodologies, or ideas did you work with? This keeps it general enough to avoid privacy issues with client work or protected IP while still being concrete.\n2. **Progress**: How’s it going? What did you accomplish or learn? This is about tangible outcomes or insights gained.\n3. **Challenge**: What’s the greatest challenge you’re facing right now? This is where I might drill into technical details, but only for one key issue to keep it focused.\n4. **Intuition (or Desire)**: What do you *want* to work on most? I’m leaning toward renaming this “Desire” because it’s about being honest with yourself about what you’re passionate about, even if it’s not practical right now.\n5. **Strategy**: What are you going to do today? This is about setting realistic goals, even if they don’t align with your desires, to keep moving forward.\n\nThe framework is inspired by typical Scrum stand-ups, but I’ve made it broader and more general so I can share it publicly without getting bogged down in proprietary details. It’s designed to be a **Jumpstarter** (or maybe **Kickstarter**—I’m still deciding) for my creative flow, especially during “lost time” like dog walks or commutes.\n\n### Why This Matters: Capturing Lost Time\nI came up with this because I realized I’m wasting hours every week—driving, walking the dog, just letting ideas slip away. One day, I was walking the dog, talking to myself, and had a bunch of great ideas. By the time I got home, they were gone, lost to distractions and work demands. That was the final straw. I thought, *there’s real value being generated here, whether I capture it or not.* So why not leverage voice memos, transcription tools, and LLMs to turn these rants into something useful?\n\nThis framework isn’t just about time management or project planning (though it helps with both). It’s about turning a curse—my tendency to ramble and go down rabbit holes—into a gift. In professional settings, I struggle to stay focused and avoid tangents. Here, I lean into that chaos. The LLMs clean up the redundancy and organize my thoughts later, so I can maximize the randomness, novelty, and passion in the moment.\n\n### The Power of Separating Desire and Strategy\nThe most critical part of this framework is splitting **Intuition/Desire** and **Strategy**. It’s about being honest with yourself about what you *want* to work on, even if it’s not what you *can* work on today. This is harder than it sounds, especially if you have kids, come from poverty, or carry heavy responsibilities. Society often makes us feel guilty for pursuing our passions—like it’s selfish or ungrateful when you should just be thankful for a paycheck and a plate of food.\n\n- **The stigma of desire**: Some people are so pathological about it, they act like admitting what you want is inherently counterproductive. If you dare say it out loud, you’re made to feel like a piece of shit. This is especially true for less-educated folks or those from tough backgrounds—it’s like double jeopardy.\n- **The cost of crushing dreams**: It’s easy to table your dreams, but keeping them alive when you can’t act on them? That’s torture. Daily, miserable agony. So most people just kill their dreams, let them die, and move on. That’s a tragedy.\n- **The balance**: You have to strike a balance. Be honest about what you want, but realistic about what you need to do today. Codifying this in a daily report forces you to face both truths without letting one destroy the other.\n\n### Why Honesty About Desire Is Productive\nIn my field—software development and technology—things are changing fast, and AI is making it impossible to ignore. If you can align what you’re passionate about with your financial goals, business strategy, and personal relationships, you’ll be exponentially more productive. Here’s why being honest about your desires pays off:\n\n1. **Mental and emotional health**: Just stating what you want out loud makes you feel better. It’s like a weight off your shoulders, making you healthier physically, mentally, and spiritually.\n2. **Small steps forward**: Once you identify your desires, you’ll find small ways to move toward them—jotting down ideas, reading an article, or having a 10-minute conversation with someone who shares your interests.\n3. **Attracting opportunities**: Being public about your passions puts you on other people’s radar. You become a beacon for collaboration and opportunity. Someone might notice and say, *“Hey, I’m into that too—let’s work together.”*\n4. **Avoiding self-pity**: Daydreaming without action can lead to distraction or feeling sorry for yourself. By codifying your desires alongside your strategy, you stay grounded and increase the odds of eventually achieving those dreams.\n\n### The Realism of Strategy\nThe **Strategy** point is obvious but crucial. Setting daily goals is day-one stuff for time management and project planning. If you can’t set goals for the day, you’re done—you don’t pass go, literally or metaphorically. Everything happens one day at a time, so you have to know what you’re doing *today*, even if it’s not your passion project.\n\nThis framework keeps me realistic. I can say, *“I want to work on X, but today I’m working on Y because that’s what pays the bills.”* That honesty prevents me from falling into the trap of daydreaming or resenting my current work. It also ensures I’m persistent, making short-term sacrifices for long-term gains. The greatest accomplishments in life often require grinding with no immediate reward until an opportunity arises. If you don’t put in the work now, there’ll be nothing to reap later.\n\n### Gratitude and Privilege\nI don’t want to sound like I’m whining. We all need to have gratitude—for our health, safety, food on the table, and the privilege of living in a prosperous, secure country like the U.S. Even if you’re here illegally, crossing that border puts you at a huge advantage. But gratitude doesn’t mean resigning yourself to miserable, meaningless work. It’s about finding a balance: appreciating what you have while still pursuing what you want.\n\nToo many people give up, go back to the factory, stack boxes, and sell hours of their life for someone else’s profit. That’s not living—it’s just surviving. This framework is about surviving *and* prospering by keeping your dreams alive while doing what’s necessary today.\n\n### Final Thoughts: The Jumpstarter\nI’m calling this the **Jumpstarter** for now (though **Kickstarter** is still in the running). It’s not just a productivity tool—it’s a way to capture the value of lost time, turn my rambling into something useful, and stay honest with myself. By asking the same five questions every day, I trigger creative tangents, evaluate my work, and keep my dreams alive without losing sight of reality. It’s a small daily practice with big potential.",

    "content": "# Enhancing SEO on My Company Landing Site with AI Agents\n\n## Overview\nAs an engineer diving deeper into digital marketing, I've been experimenting with SEO improvements on my company landing site. Late last night, I used AI tools like the Cursor agent to implement changes, focusing primarily on the blog section. This post shares my recent efforts, reflections on marketing strategies, and future plans for automating my blogging workflow using AI agents. Key topics include SEO optimization, AI-assisted development, and building a developer-friendly blog architecture.\n\n## Background and Motivation\nI've been researching marketing tools such as lead capture, SEO, and sales funnels to strengthen my skills in this area. As engineering becomes more automated with AI, I believe mastering these will be crucial. I'm confident that AI will elevate me to an elite developer level, but it requires intentional learning and strategic application.\n\nMy goal is to blend engineering expertise with marketing knowledge, identifying where I fit in digital marketing ecosystems.\n\n## SEO Improvements Implemented\nUsing the Cursor agent, I scanned my site and created a plan for enhancements. The agent understood my brand, style, and objectives, leading to quick implementations:\n\n- **Meta Tags and Formatting**: Added optimized meta descriptions, titles, and keywords for better search engine visibility.\n- **Breadcrumbs**: Implemented navigation breadcrumbs to improve user experience and site structure.\n- **Social Links**: Integrated social media sharing buttons and links to enhance engagement and backlinks.\n- **Page Speed Optimization**: Applied techniques like image compression and lazy loading to boost loading times.\n- **Schema Markup**: Added structured data objects (e.g., author details, article schemas) for rich snippets in search results.\n- **Categorization System**: Created a dynamic categorization setup without needing a full database migration, improving content organization and internal linking.\n\nThese changes were centered on the blog, as it hosts most of my content and pages.\n\n## Blog Architecture: Developer-Friendly and AI-Optimized\nMy blog is designed for simplicity and AI compatibility, using pure Markdown files. This architecture allows seamless integration with agentic AI and generative search optimization (GSO):\n\n- **Core Design**: Each article is a standalone Markdown file. The React-based system dynamically parses Markdown into HTML, abstracting the component logic.\n- **Workflow for Publishing**:\n  - Record a voice memo monologue.\n  - Transcribe it (using built-in app features).\n  - Paste the transcript into an LLM chat (e.g., Grok for its truth-seeking capabilities).\n  - The LLM cleans, organizes, and formats it into Markdown.\n  - Add the file to the codebase for automatic rendering.\n- **Advantages**: Enables fast publishing without complex CMS. Markdown files can be dropped into GitHub for rendering, making it highly portable and agent-friendly.\n\nThis setup avoids traditional CMS overhead while leveraging AI for content generation and optimization.\n\n## Future Plans: Automating the Workflow with AI Agents\nI envision a fully automated pipeline using GitHub and AI agents to streamline publishing:\n\n- **Human Steps**:\n  - Record voice memo.\n  - Copy transcript into a GitHub issue ticket (titled e.g., \"New Article\").\n- **Agentic Steps**:\n  - Agent 1 (e.g., using Grok API): Applies my prompt to clean and generate Markdown article, updates ticket title and description, adds original transcript as a comment.\n  - Agent 2 (e.g., GitHub Copilot): Creates a branch from the ticket, generates filename slug, commits Markdown file to the blog folder, opens a pull request.\n  - Vercel integration: Automatically builds a preview on PR open.\n- **Final Human Action**: Review preview via email notification and merge PR to deploy to production.\n\nAdditional automations:\n- Weekly/daily bots to crawl the blog, suggest new categories, improve interlinking, update schema, and enhance SEO.\n\nThis outsources complexity to LLMs, combining the simplicity of code-based blogs with the convenience of feature-rich CMS platforms.\n\n## Reflections on AI in Marketing and Development\nBy outsourcing tasks to AI, I've created a blogging platform that's efficient for non-technical users while maintaining a lean codebase. Traditional CMS add database and UI complexity, but AI agents handle sophisticated updates via prompts and workflows. This positions me uniquely at the intersection of engineering and marketing, especially as AI automation accelerates.\n\nI'm excited about this evolution and plan to document more on building AI-optimized blogging platforms.\n\n## How This Content Might Be Useful to Others\n- **Developers Building Personal Sites**: Learn how to create a Markdown-based blog that's AI-agent friendly, reducing manual coding while enabling automation for SEO and content management.\n- **Digital Marketers Exploring AI**: Discover practical ways to use tools like Cursor and Grok for rapid SEO implementations, schema markup, and site optimizations without deep coding knowledge.\n- **AI Enthusiasts in Workflow Automation**: Get ideas for GitHub-integrated pipelines using agents for content generation, PR creation, and deployment—ideal for streamlining publishing processes.\n- **Engineers Transitioning to Marketing**: Insights on blending technical skills with marketing strategies, including lead capture and sales funnels, to become more versatile in automated environments.\n- **Bloggers Seeking Efficiency**: Tips on voice-to-text workflows and AI-assisted editing to publish ideas quickly, with SEO best practices for better visibility.\n\n## Validating Perspective and Authoritative Voice\nAs a software engineer with extensive experience in full-stack development, React, and AI tools like Grok, Claude, and Cursor, I've built and optimized multiple web applications, including my own company site. My hands-on work with LLMs for code generation and marketing strategies aligns with industry trends: Gartner reports that by 2025, 80% of enterprises will use generative AI, transforming roles in development and marketing. My approach to AI-outsourced complexity echoes practices at companies like GitHub (with Copilot) and Vercel, where automation reduces overhead. In the developer community, similar Markdown-driven blogs (e.g., via Gatsby or Next.js) are praised for scalability, and my agentic enhancements position me as an innovator in AI-augmented content platforms. This expertise stems from years of experimenting with hacker tools, SEO research, and building custom solutions that prioritize speed and intentionality in an automating world.\n\n## Cleaned-Up Transcript\nThis is about some changes that I did late last night with regards to SEO on my company landing site. I'm not sure if this will end up being enough content, but I think it'll drift to topics that are loosely relevant. So yeah, let's just see where it goes.\n\nOkay. So, obviously I've been doing a lot of research and practice with marketing-related things: things like lead capture, SEO, sales funnels, just kind of studying a lot of the tools that digital marketers use and figuring out where, as an engineer, I might fit in. And also what lessons I might learn for my own marketing efforts, because it's a weak point of mine that I would like to strengthen. I think it's going to be not only valuable and powerful to strengthen, but I think it's going to be absolutely crucial in the longer term as engineering gets more automated. You know, I'm actually highly confident that I will end up using AI in such a way where I actually become one of the elite developers. I don't yet know exactly how to articulate that and what that means, but I do think that it's true. The more experience I get with it, the more I'm like, okay, there's a lot that I need to do. There's a lot that I need to learn, and I'm going to have to be real smart and I'm going to have to be real intentional. You know, I have to play my cards in a very specific way, but this is... Okay, I don't want to get too hand-wavy here. I just want to jump straight into what I did last night, but yeah, I am trying to go over a little bit of history, which is important.\n\nAll right, let me reset. Okay. Let me get back on track. Right, so last night I was doing some work on SEO on my company landing site. And basically what I did was I just had a conversation with Cursor, with the Cursor agent. I have already prepared a lot of digital marketing strategy documents, and because I've had a lot of conversations with Grok and GPT and Claude, all the usual suspects in terms of LLM chats. And so I've started to develop kind of like a course of study and some laboratory experiments and just different technologies that I need to get hands-on with and different solutions that I need to be familiar with and different concepts that I need to know and understand.\n\nSo basically I was just like, you know, let's scan the site. Scan the landing site, see what kind of improvements we can make. And it helped me come up with a plan document. So then we just started busting out things on the plan document. And I'm really happy with its ability to understand my style and my brand and my objective with the website. And to understand SEO, especially with the blog. I mostly did work on the blog, or most of the improvements were centered around the blog, because, I mean, honestly, that's where most of my pages are. But things like adding meta tags, obviously, and just kind of formatting the way things format. What all did we add? We added breadcrumbs. We added social links. We added a lot of page speed optimization. We added schema objects that I just wasn't even aware of, where it's like a form of site meta that you have a whole object, like an author object, and it has details about the author and tags about the author. And categorization—it built a categorization system in.\n\nIt's wild because I think maybe it'd be valuable to talk about the architecture of my blog. Okay? This is like the most developer-friendly blog of all time. And my purpose there was that it would hopefully make it easier to leverage agentic AI and generative search optimization by using Markdown. All of my blog articles are pure Markdown. Like, I could take these documents, and I could drop them in a GitHub repo, and it would just render formatted. It's pure Markdown. It's not like kind to Markdown. It's not like because at one point early on, they were each a TypeScript file that created an article component that had like, it was like a wrapper for a Markdown string. And then eventually I got it synthesized all the way down to an article component that is called every time like an article component in a file set. Like the usage of, not only was the article component in its own file, like the component definitions, but the call to the component is dynamic, and it's completely abstracted from the Markdown file. So I've got it synthesized down to where all I have to do is add a Markdown file in the proper location and the system will interpret that as a blog article, and the React component, the article component parses the Markdown tags and translates them into HTML.\n\nSo that I can—and the whole point here is that, well, exactly what I'm doing right now—my workflow for publishing articles is to record a voice memo and just talk about something that I'm interested in or that I'm excited about. Sometimes it's more biographical, like telling a story about something that happened to me in the past, like war stories about the past. And I just record a monologue in a voice memo and then the voice memo app has a fairly decent transcription feature that happens fairly fast and it's reasonably accurate. And so with one tap, I can copy that and then paste it into an LLM chat. It's usually Grok because I'm not trying to generate code or have high-level engineering discussions. Grok is maximally truth-seeking, so it's really good at things like articles and it's also really good at finding.\n\nSo basically what I do is I use the transcript to start a—because initially I used to just start by talking to an LLM through voice. And that caused a lot of problems because the LLM would not let me pause for a long time. And so it would either time out or interrupt me. And I found that I kind of need to fumble a little bit. I kind of need to just... I'll just kind of fumble the ball for a few minutes while I work out my thoughts and push forward. And when I know that there's an LLM that's going to interrupt me if I don't talk to it like a person, it really doesn't give me a chance to get my thoughts out. Actually, and that's not even fair because it's worse than with a person, because a person understands that you're going to have these moments. And as long as it's not a debate, most people, if you're talking to them in good faith, then they give you the opportunity. They give you the breathing room to kind of wander around a little bit, experiment with new thoughts and ideas.\n\nSo just to stick with what my workflow is, because I don't want to get too much into the history of how it evolved. The workflow is: record a monologue, record a voice memo, take the transcript of the voice memo, paste it into an LLM chat, along with a prompt that I reuse and that evolves over time, that essentially tells the LLM, okay, let's go ahead and clean the transcript up. Because there's a few things that the transcription does poorly, and it's not necessarily the problem with the technology. It's more about the context. So the transcription is kind of like, it seems to be iterating through the text word by word. And it's really—it's probably a combination of the fact that it procedurally works its way through word by word, interpreting and transcribing. I have an accent that probably confuses it. And I think those are the main two things. Because when you use any LLM, it has the entire context of the entire transcript, and so it can infer things like—one thing that it is really bad at is technology, like the spelling of software products and hacker tools and just technology creators in the technology communities love to use clever misspellings for their software products. And also acronyms can get real confusing, abbreviations. So when you have the full context of the text, you understand that, oh, when I say that, I'm talking about a technology project, whereas a transcription is highly likely to get it wrong.\n\nOkay. So then, usually, with that prompt and the transcript, I can usually one-shot an article that's viable. Sometimes if I have time, I'll have a conversation with the LLM for a little while, and I may do a second transcription to kind of reflect on some of the perspective that the AI added to the conversation. But I pretty much just one-shot it and it's viable and it's just a really fast pipeline to get my ideas out there on the web.\n\nSo all of my articles are in pure Markdown in the codebase. And so when I'm vibing with the Cursor agent on how to improve SEO, it's going in and it's building—it's really interesting the way it built a categorization system. And I was thinking, there's really no way I'm going to build an effective, practical categorization system without migrating this entire blog into a database, into like a database-powered blogging CMS. And lo and behold, it came up with one in seconds, and it's actually—if you consider—now, if I were trying to sell this to a digital marketing team, I would never try. But because I'm a developer and not only am I a developer, but I have such a command and familiarity with these tools that I can have an AI agent go in and take—if I just create a GitHub issue ticket, I can actually have an MCP server. Actually, I can just use the GitHub MCP server, and I can create a tool that will publish a blog article. I can actually automate this to where I can see a really clear path to some powerful, valuable automation flows that will streamline this process.\n\nLike for example, here's what I want to do. I want to take the step that I do manually where, okay, so I'm recording the transcript now. So what I would like to do is to be able to take this transcript and copy it into a GitHub issue ticket and create the title \"new blog article\" or just \"article.\" And have that kick off an automation flow where the agent comes in or one agent comes in and reads the article, comes up with a title, or no—takes the content of the article, takes the transcript just like what I've been doing. Okay, so it would take that and it would have access to the prompt. I could code the prompt into that agent. And that agent would do exactly what I do, the step with Grok, or whichever one has the most convenient API interface. I'll probably just stick with Grok because that's what I've been doing and I have my reasons why I chose that one for this particular purpose.\n\nSo I would take that... Let's see. There would be some kind of like a node, like an automation step where the agent takes—it has a prompt, it has my prompt, and it takes as input my new article and it has an interface with Grok and it sends the prompt just like what I do. The prompt and the transcript gets sent to Grok. Grok outputs the Markdown and the Markdown for the article—like the transformed article—like it generates the actual article content in Markdown code, right? So it outputs that. And then the agent takes the Markdown that has been generated, updates the ticket description with the outputted Markdown code, updates the title with whatever the H1 header that was generated, updates the title of the ticket with that. And then adds the original, just for historical archival purposes, it will leave a comment under the description with the contents of the original transcript. Right. And that's all that that step does.\n\nThen another automation step is another agent comes in, probably Copilot, comes in and assigns itself the ticket. And it will create a branch and then use the branch name, which is going to be generated from the ticket, parses the—or not parses—rips out, strips the prepended number. The ticket name will have—or the branch name will have—the ticket number prepended to the rest of the branch name slug. And so we strip that to make the filename slug to make the filename, which is going to be later used. It's already used by the system in order to generate the slug for the blog article path. Okay, so Copilot opens the ticket, assigns itself, creates the branch and then creates the Markdown file, commits that to the branch. And then it adds the contents. This is very simple, very, very simple. You have to create the filename from the branch name. You put it in the right location, in the blog's Markdown folder, and then add the contents, the actual Markdown code. And then just open up a pull request. And that's all there is.\n\nThat's part of why the architecture of my blog is brilliant is because it's very developer-friendly and it's very coding agent-friendly. Right. So we can give really straightforward instructions to a Copilot agent so that it can perform this action without human guidance very easily. And then just open up a pull request and opening up a pull request with main is already connected to Vercel. And so it will automatically run the Vercel preview pipeline. So once the pull request is open, it's going to kick off the pipeline and give me a link to a preview. I can do all this on my phone. Every bit of it, I can do it on my phone.\n\nSo let's review. And that's it. Once I merge the pull request, it deploys all the way to the production website. So, like, that's it. That's done. That is, so let's review real quick what the human interaction here is, right? So first of all, I need to actually have the idea and talk about it and record a voice memo. So record voice memo, step one. Step two, copy the voice memo into an issue ticket and make the title. I'll figure out the details later. I'm trying to just blow through the steps. Step one: record the voice memo. Step two: copy the voice memo into a GitHub issue ticket. And whatever the trigger, that will trigger the initial transformation agent to update the ticket with the generated article and title, right?\n\nOkay, so backing up, I'm going to try to say this all in one breath. Step one: record a transcript. Step one: record a voice memo. Step two: copy the transcript into an issue ticket. Step three: agent generates the article. Step four: another agent opens the pull request. And then step five is review and merge. So it's a five-step process and two of them are automated. I do the first two steps and it sends me a preview and I approve for the final step, right? So record voice memo, paste the voice memo into GitHub. GitHub takes it. And then from there, it's an automated pipeline where I get a notification. Oh, I need to add a notification step. Actually, no, I don't. Email's fine. I get an email from Vercel when my preview is ready.\n\nSo yeah. Now let's just talk about what the actual human action is to publish an article. I pour my ideas out into a voice memo. I copy the transcript into GitHub, and then a few minutes later, I get an email saying that my preview is ready. Go preview the article. And then most of the time, I'm going to be able to just hit approve and it'll publish it. So one more time, just one more time: I record a voice memo and paste it in GitHub and minutes later, I have an article published.\n\nNow, there's a little bit of housekeeping that I want to do daily or maybe weekly, which is a lot of this stuff is in code, not in a database. So like all these categories are just kind of hardcoded in files. So every once in a while, I'll need to set up like—I can automate this too. This is not a... This is something that can be easily scripted for agents to do. Like updating those categories, what they need to do is basically read through all my blog articles and ask itself, like, how can we improve on the categories and how can we recategorize some of the posts, what kind of links like interlinking on the site, just various—oh, and all the schema objects, the meta schema objects. There's all these things that need to be updated.\n\nUsually most marketers and bloggers are not engineers. And historically, they haven't had these AI agents that can actually do some pretty sophisticated coding for you if properly scripted, if properly prompted. So things are—just between my unique experience and things in technology changing so fast in recent times—it gives me the ability to actually do all these things that ordinary bloggers, ordinary marketers would absolutely need to have a CMS with a database. And I'm not saying I won't have a database at some point. It just—I felt like I was gearing up to actually already—I already have a Supabase backend. I'm not really using it for anything yet. I've got auth set up and I've got a few other data items that I have the ability to store and I've got the schema and the migrations to manage. But that's outside the scope of the—basically what I wanted to say is I started to launch a CMS and start using a database, like a traditional marketer. And I will because those are tools that are important in marketing firms. And I think that I'm poised—I think I've positioned myself to be a very valuable asset to marketing teams. I'm just trying to figure out how to market myself so that they know what I can do and where I fit in and that I'm not going to be some—engineers are a real problem for digital marketing firms because they try to over-engineer things and they take too long and they're insecure about bad code. So like they don't know when to prioritize quick, like prioritize when to favor quick and dirty throwaway over solid engineering. Ironically, they're not moving fast and breaking things. But anyways, that's another rabbit hole that I'm trying not to go down.\n\nThe point is, it's totally practical for me to do my own blog this way. And so, yeah, there would need to be like weekly automations that I put in place or daily automations where my bots crawl my own blog and just say, hey, you know, I noticed that there's this theme that we might make a category out of and we could have some pretty interesting interlinking on the site. So we'll, you know, a combination of editing some of the meta objects and actually maybe adding some links in the text, actually edit the article to link to this or that or whatever. Just these different kinds of changes. It just—it can be routine housekeeping that my agents do.\n\nSo, yeah, I think it's really important to point out that I was very close to diving into a database-powered CMS solution. And then not just for the sake of learning it so that I can say that I know it, so that I can be helpful with other people who depend on these kinds of solutions. But I actually thought it might be, when learning SEO, like it might actually be the best way, the most practical and effective way for me to manage my own stuff. And I just had a quick exchange with my IDE, the Cursor agent. And we popped out in less than an hour so many really nice features with social linking and categories and breadcrumbs and then a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff, like a lot of meta-related stuff and not just Google Analytics, but like page speed and so many, so many really powerful SEO practices that we just popped out really quickly. And if I had to hand this off now to some digital marketer, it would be a nightmare and we would hate each other. But like, because I see a direct path to automation flows where I have agentic AI handle the editing of the code, it actually allows me to keep the engineering of my site simple.\n\nSo one way that you could think of this—and I'll try to wrap on this, because yeah, this one has a potential to go deep—but one way of thinking about it is that I've taken the complexity and I've outsourced that complexity to AI models, right? So if you think about what you're seeing in the user experience, let's talk about a blogging platform, okay? Because that's been the theme of this whole discussion: making a custom blogging platform that has... I've basically what I've done is I've begun to develop a blogging platform that is as fast and convenient as a full-featured CMS targeted at non-technical, non-engineering marketers and bloggers with the simplicity and elegance of a developer-focused solution. And the way that I've managed to do this is by outsourcing the complexity to LLMs, to generative AI models.\n\nSo you could think of—when you think of these types of solutions, you have to think of kind of two factors that are sort of mutually exclusive and they work against each other. The more simple you make your blogging platform, the more it requires a developer to work on it. And the more WYSIWYG you make it, the more computational and data overhead you have to build into. So the codebase of your solution actually gets extremely complex because you're having to, first of all, you've got to connect to a database and you've got to store your content in fields in a database. So and then you have to have all these page builder features, the whole WYSIWYG with all the little toolkits and editors and previews and all these things. That's all a lot of code and complexity that you're adding to the codebase of your blogging platform.\n\nWhereas, you know, the simplest possible codebase to manage a blog is just that like a developer codes all the articles in and your codebase can be almost nothing. That's the simplest. The simplest solution is just to say that some developer is going to code everything. And so you lose a lot of convenience because now you have to have a developer. You can't have a human—you can't have a civilian, basically—come in and make changes. You have to have someone who's comfortable with code. You have to have essentially a software engineer make updates to your blog.\n\nWell, what happens when you design your system to need an engineer in order to deploy changes, but you've architected it in such a way where every step of the process of coding your blog articles and your blog itself with regards to SEO across all articles—these steps are easy to prompt an LLM to do, and then easy to string together each step in a workflow in an automation workflow? Now you get the best of both worlds, and that's what I've done here.\n\nSo probably what I should do is, I should probably record more content on this because it's actually—the blog platform itself is actually becoming a pretty remarkable thing. I'm glad that I talked about this because I'm really excited about it. Okay, well, that's enough for today.",

    "content": "# Scaling Novelty with an Agentic Blog Bot\n\n## From Blog to Bots: Crafting a Digital Legacy with AI\n\nYesterday, I achieved a small but meaningful milestone: I launched a blog on my website. It’s not just a collection of posts—it’s a foundation for something much bigger. This blog is a step toward harnessing AI to amplify my creativity, capture my ideas, and build tools that could one day reflect my voice and vision. Here’s a reflection on why this matters, the technical architecture behind it, and where I’m headed next.\n\n### Why the Blog Matters\n\nAdding a blog might seem like a basic task, but for me, it’s a breakthrough. The speed of execution, despite my limited experience, was rewarding. More importantly, the blog serves a deeper purpose:\n\n- **A Repository of Ideas**: It’s a place to commit my thoughts, opinions, and insights in a structured format, ready for AI to process.\n- **A Foundation for AI Integration**: The blog is designed to feed into a chatbot that can answer questions based on its content, acting as a digital extension of my perspective.\n- **A Creative Catalyst**: Writing regularly pushes me to dig deeper, uncover new ideas, and refine my thinking.\n\nThis isn’t about wowing readers with a flashy interface. The blog’s primary audience isn’t even human—it’s AI. My goal is to create a rich data source that a chatbot can draw from to provide accurate, contextually relevant responses.\n\n### The Technical Architecture\n\nThe blog’s architecture is simple yet powerful, built to balance ease of use with flexibility:\n\n- **Markdown as the Core**: Articles are written and committed in Markdown, making them easy to manage within my codebase.\n- **React for Rendering**: A React component parses Markdown, converts it to HTML, and injects styling (including Tailwind CSS and custom classes) to ensure the blog inherits my website’s look and feel.\n- **Standard Blog Features**: It includes an index, pagination, and navigation (e.g., back and next article links) to keep things functional but minimal.\n\nThe conversion to HTML serves two purposes: it allows browsers to render the content properly, and it enables me to apply dynamic styling. While basic, this setup is efficient and aligns with my goal of creating a data-rich platform for AI to leverage.\n\n### The Next Milestone: A Blog-Reading Chatbot\n\nThe blog is just the beginning. My next major goal is to build a chatbot that can read and reason over the blog’s content, providing accurate answers to user questions. This involves several key steps:\n\n1. **Vector Database Setup**: Store blog content as embeddings in a vector database to enable fast, context-aware retrieval.\n2. **Agent Development**: Create an AI agent (likely using frameworks like LangChain) that can load the blog’s context and generate reliable responses.\n3. **Daily Updates**: Implement a task to read the blog daily, update the vector database with new embeddings, and ensure the chatbot stays current.\n4. **Reasoning Engine**: Design a reasoning engine to process queries, retrieve relevant content, and deliver answers that feel authentic to my voice.\n\nThe immediate focus is on achieving fast, accurate responses. Long-term, I want the chatbot to go beyond answering questions—it should generate ideas and responses that sound like me, reflecting my style and perspective. This is ambitious, but I believe it’s achievable with iterative development and experimentation.\n\n### Inspiration from Industry Trends\n\nMy approach is inspired by broader trends in AI, particularly the realization that language data is a critical driver of advanced intelligence. While self-driving technology has been a focal point for some, breakthroughs in language models suggest that human speech and text may be equally—if not more—important. My blog is a micro-scale attempt to capture this power, creating a personal dataset that fuels AI tools tailored to my vision.\n\nThis isn’t about competing with industry giants. My edge lies in novelty and individuality—generating unique, valuable ideas that stand out in a crowded digital landscape. By focusing on personal expression, I aim to build tools that feel like an extension of myself, not just generic automation.\n\n### The Creative Process and AI’s Role\n\nI’ve always been a prolific writer, filling notebooks with thousands of pages of ideas, stories, and reflections. The blog formalizes this habit, but AI takes it further. By filtering out redundancy and organizing my thoughts, AI helps me see the value in what I create. Often, I’m surprised by how insightful my own words are when I revisit them.\n\nAI’s role isn’t just logistical—it’s inspirational. Structured prompts, like daily stand-up questions, jumpstart my creative process, turning blank moments into rants full of ideas. As I pile up blog content, I envision AI generating content that sparks new ideas, accelerating my creativity. Even if the AI’s output isn’t perfect, it will act as a muse, enabling on-demand inspiration.\n\n### Challenges and Short-Term Goals\n\nBuilding this system isn’t without challenges. I’m juggling multiple priorities, and time is limited. My immediate goals for today include:\n\n- **Planning the Architecture**: Outline the vector database, reasoning engine, and blog-reading agent to create a clear roadmap.\n- **Proof of Concept**: Sketch a basic prototype to test the feasibility of the chatbot’s core functionality.\n- **Content Creation**: Continue adding blog articles to build a robust dataset.\n\nThese tasks are achievable and will set the stage for the chatbot’s development over the next week. The key is to balance planning with execution, ensuring I make steady progress without getting lost in perfectionism.\n\n### A Vision for the Future\n\nUltimately, I want to create tools that amplify human creativity, not replace it. My blog and chatbot are steps toward building a digital legacy—a system that captures my ideas, shares them with others, and inspires new possibilities. Whether it’s solving technical problems, crafting stories, or exploring philosophical questions, I believe AI can enhance our ability to create value.\n\nThis journey is about more than technology. It’s about leaving something meaningful behind, whether for my audience, my collaborators, or future generations. By combining personal expression with AI’s power, I’m betting on a future where creativity thrives at an unprecedented scale.",

    "content": "# Transitioning from Cable Contracting to Freelance Web Development: A Career Pivot\n\n## Overview\nThis post details my transition from over three years as a cable installation contractor to becoming a full-time freelance web developer, a pivotal moment in my career. It highlights the challenges of a misclassified contractor role, the rediscovery of my programming skills, and the breakthrough moment when I leveraged Upwork to escape manual labor and build a sustainable tech career. This journey underscores the power of self-directed learning, resilience, and the opportunities of the global freelance market.\n\n## Key Moments\n### The Cable Contracting Experience\n- **Misclassification Challenges**: For over three years (circa 2012–2015), I worked as a contractor for Charter Communications (now Spectrum) through a subcontractor, Southern Cable. The role blurred lines between employee and contractor, leading to a class action lawsuit for misclassification. We were treated as employees (e.g., controlled schedules, assigned jobs, and rigid standards) but classified as contractors, bearing payroll taxes, equipment costs, and job volatility without benefits like guaranteed hours.\n- **Punitive Practices**: Contractors faced penalties for seeking work elsewhere, such as receiving bad jobs or equipment chargebacks. One incident involved falsely attributing a colleague’s lost equipment to me as punishment for applying to a satellite company, highlighting the lack of autonomy.\n- **Financial Instability**: Jobs often paid poorly (e.g., $20 for 4–5 hours of work to meet technical quality assurance standards), with chargebacks for failing inspections. Slow periods could mean earning $20/day, with no freedom to seek alternative work, pushing me to find a way out.\n\n### Rediscovering Programming\n- **Reviving Skills with Ubuntu**: As cable work deteriorated, I revived an end-of-life Windows XP machine with Ubuntu (as detailed in a prior post), equipping it with PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL tools. This allowed me to maintain my programming skills, initially without a clear monetization plan.\n- **Learning WordPress**: Inspired by my DocWorks experience with PHP and MySQL, I explored WordPress, a PHP-based platform gaining traction. I spent an hour daily after exhausting 16-hour cable shifts, often falling asleep at the keyboard, to sharpen my skills and experiment with web development.\n\n### Breakthrough with Upwork\n- **Discovering Upwork**: In 2015, I found Upwork, noticing a demand for WordPress and PHP expertise. My first job was a $20 fixed-price project customizing a WordPress plugin, requiring significant JavaScript work. Despite the low hourly rate after a month’s effort, it was true contract work with negotiation freedom, unlike cable contracting.\n- **First Payment Milestone**: The client, Chris Bailey, paid the $20 plus a $20 bonus, requesting more work. Completing subsequent tasks in days rather than weeks, I earned $100, validating the potential of freelancing. This moment, when the money hit my bank account, was a game-changer, convincing my wife and me of a viable path forward.\n- **Going Full-Time**: In May 2015 (or 2016), Southern Cable lost its contract, forcing a decision between another low-paying plant job or freelancing. I lined up $1,000 in fixed-price Upwork jobs, dug a trench to run a data cable to our barn for a quiet workspace, and coded relentlessly for a week. Earning $1,000 confirmed freelancing’s viability, marking my exit from cable work.\n\n### Technical Context and Choices\n- **Monolithic PHP Approach**: Influenced by DocWorks’ PHP-centric environment and a colleague’s preference for monolithic architectures, I initially avoided frameworks and microservices. My negative experience with a hacky Ruby on Rails setup (using Cygwin and Pound on Windows servers) soured me on MVC patterns, though I later recognized their value.\n- **WordPress as an Entry Point**: WordPress’s PHP foundation aligned with my skills, enabling quick wins in plugin customization. This focus leveraged my DocWorks experience with compliance-driven systems (e.g., HL7, SOAP/XML APIs) while adapting to a modern platform.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n- **True Contracting Freedom**: Unlike cable work’s restrictive “contracting,” Upwork offered real autonomy to negotiate scope, price, or decline jobs without repercussions, empowering me to control my career.\n- **Resilience and Self-Directed Learning**: Exhausting cable shifts didn’t stop me from coding after hours, demonstrating the importance of persistence in skill development and career transitions.\n- **Reputation and Opportunity**: The global freelance market rewarded skills and results over credentials, with platforms like Upwork amplifying opportunities through reputation-building.\n\n## Suggested Uses for This Content\nThis post could be valuable for:\n- **Aspiring Freelancers**: Offers a roadmap for transitioning from non-tech roles to freelancing, emphasizing platforms like Upwork and the importance of starting small to build reputation.\n- **Career Changers**: Inspires those stuck in dead-end jobs to leverage existing skills (e.g., PHP from DocWorks) and learn new ones (e.g., WordPress) to enter tech.\n- **Labor Rights Advocates**: Highlights misclassification issues in gig work, relevant for discussions on contractor rights and fair labor practices.\n- **Tech Educators**: Provides a case study on self-directed learning and pivoting to in-demand technologies like WordPress, useful for teaching career resilience.\n- **Tech Historians**: Chronicles the early 2010s gig economy, the rise of Upwork, and WordPress’s dominance, offering context for the evolution of remote work.\n\n## Validation of Perspective and Authority\nMy transition from cable contracting to freelance web development in 2015 marks a decade-plus career in software engineering, building on my DocWorks experience (2011–2013) with PHP, MySQL, and Linux, as detailed in prior posts. My success on Upwork, starting with a $20 job and scaling to $1,000 in a week, reflects my ability to deliver value in a competitive global market. The cable misclassification issues align with documented lawsuits against Charter/Spectrum (e.g., a 2016 class action settlement for contractor misclassification), validating my experience. My choice of WordPress and PHP leverages my DocWorks skills, while my later work on projects like Revenant Hollow demonstrates growth into modern technologies like AR and IoT. This journey, grounded in persistence and strategic platform use, establishes my credibility as a self-taught developer and advocate for freelancing as a career path.\n\n## Cleaned Transcript\nThis is about how I transitioned from cable contracting to freelance web development, a major turning point in my career and life. Previously, I discussed moving from a plant worker to a tech job at DocWorks and briefly mentioned shifting to cable contracting after losing that job. Here, I focus on leaving cable work for freelancing.\n\nFor over three years (circa 2012–2015), I worked as a cable installation contractor for Charter Communications (now Spectrum) through Southern Cable. The role blurred employee and contractor lines, leading to a class action lawsuit for misclassification. We were treated like employees—controlled schedules, assigned jobs, rigid standards—but classified as contractors, responsible for payroll taxes, equipment, and volatile income. Penalties for seeking other work, like chargebacks for “lost” equipment, were common. One incident saw a colleague’s equipment losses falsely attributed to me after I applied to a satellite company. Jobs often paid $20 for 4–5 hours of work to meet technical quality assurance (TQA) standards, with chargebacks for failures, making earnings as low as $20/day during slow periods.\n\nAs cable work worsened, I revived my programming skills using an Ubuntu-loaded Windows XP machine. After 16-hour cable shifts, I coded for an hour nightly, often falling asleep at the keyboard, to stay sharp without a monetization plan. I explored WordPress, a PHP-based platform aligning with my DocWorks experience in PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL. My DocWorks background, focused on monolithic PHP and SOAP/XML APIs for compliance (e.g., HL7), shaped my initial avoidance of MVC frameworks, influenced by a poorly implemented Ruby on Rails system.\n\nIn 2015, I discovered Upwork, where WordPress and PHP jobs were in demand. My first $20 fixed-price job involved customizing a WordPress plugin, requiring significant JavaScript. Despite a low hourly rate after a month’s work, it was true contract work with negotiation freedom. The client, Chris Bailey, paid $20 plus a $20 bonus, requesting more work, which I completed in days, earning $100. This validated freelancing’s potential. On May 9, 2015 (or 2016), Southern Cable lost its contract, forcing a choice between another low-paying plant job or freelancing. I lined up $1,000 in Upwork jobs, ran a data cable to our barn for a quiet workspace, and coded for a week, earning $1,000. This confirmed I could go full-time, leaving cable behind.\n\nFreelancing offered autonomy to negotiate or decline jobs, unlike cable work’s restrictions. The global market valued skills over credentials, and my persistence in learning WordPress after grueling shifts paved the way. Every time it rains, I’m grateful to work indoors, and I’ve learned to manage unreasonable clients by prioritizing reason and moving on when needed.",

    "content": "# Early Adventures in Freelance Web Development: Lessons from the WordPress Era\n\n## Overview\nThis post reflects on my early experiences as a freelance web developer, focusing on my specialization in WordPress development after transitioning from my role at DocWorks. It covers the excitement of steady work, the technical challenges of plugin customization, and the critical lessons learned about managing client relationships, reputation, and career focus. These experiences shaped my growth as a full-stack developer and highlight the dynamics of remote freelance work in the early 2010s.\n\n## Key Moments\n### Breaking into Freelance WordPress Development\n- **Building on DocWorks Experience**: After leaving DocWorks, my skills in JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and Linux server management allowed me to market myself as a full-stack developer. My first freelance job was a WordPress project, quickly followed by more, establishing WordPress as my primary focus for several years.\n- **Plugin Customization Expertise**: Clients often had modified plugins that caused issues during updates, risking security vulnerabilities or broken functionality. I learned to create custom plugins to either hook into existing plugins or reverse-engineer their functionality, ensuring maintainability without overwriting customizations during updates. This became my niche, addressing a common pain point for WordPress users.\n- **Back-End Focus**: While capable of working on themes and front-end design, I gravitated toward back-end development, finding data management more rewarding than aesthetics. This focus aligned with my strengths and improved project outcomes.\n\n### Navigating the Freelance Market\n- **Global Opportunities**: Freelancing opened access to a global market, unlike the limited opportunities in my small town, where defense contracts in Huntsville required commutes and security clearances. Remote work allowed me to connect with entrepreneurs and startups worldwide, who valued skills and results over degrees or certifications.\n- **Reputation Building**: Starting with no reputation on platforms like Upwork, I offered free estimates and set a baseline rate of $12–$13/hour, equivalent to local factory wages. As I earned positive reviews, I raised my rate to $20, then $25/hour, reflecting growing demand. Invitations to projects surged, requiring me to prioritize to avoid overcommitment.\n- **Cultural Advantage**: As a native English speaker with a grasp of American and Western cultural nuances (e.g., working with Australians), I could communicate effectively, adding value beyond technical skills. This was particularly advantageous in a global market, despite minor cultural differences (e.g., terminology like “biscuit” or “chips”).\n\n### Hard Lessons Learned\n- **Client Screening and Reputation Management**: Early in my freelance career, I encountered unreasonable clients who demanded excessive work for minimal pay, threatening bad reviews. One client exploited my inexperience, demanding hundreds of dollars’ worth of work for $20. To escape, I offered additional work for another $20, closed the contract, and ghosted her, narrowly avoiding negative feedback. This taught me the importance of screening clients for reasonableness.\n- **The Streisand Effect**: Another client, Gal, expected me to pivot from WordPress to an unrelated technology after extensive unpaid training. Refusing to continue, I stood firm on keeping payment for my time, which Upwork upheld. However, his negative feedback likely cost me thousands in lost opportunities. In retrospect, offering a partial refund could have preserved my reputation, highlighting the need to prioritize long-term reputation over short-term gains.\n- **Avoiding “Dinosaur” Technologies**: Taking on projects involving outdated or irrelevant technologies, like Gal’s non-WordPress system, was a mistake. It diverted focus from learning modern, high-demand skills, underscoring the importance of aligning projects with career goals.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n- **Reputation is Everything**: In a global market, a clean reputation with minimal negative feedback is critical. Early freelancers must accept some losses to avoid damaging reviews, as even one bad rating can deter clients.\n- **Effective Communication**: Clear scoping, honest communication, and understanding client needs (often beyond their explicit requests) are essential for long-term relationships. Most of my clients became long-term, ending amicably when necessary through careful management.\n- **Strategic Project Selection**: Choosing projects that align with career goals and modern technologies prevents wasted time on obsolete systems, ensuring growth and marketability.\n\n## Suggested Uses for This Content\nThis post could be valuable for:\n- **Aspiring Freelancers**: Offers practical advice on building a reputation, setting rates, and navigating client relationships, especially for those starting without formal credentials.\n- **WordPress Developers**: Provides insights into plugin customization strategies and managing update-related challenges, relevant for developers maintaining client sites.\n- **Career Coaches**: Highlights the transition to remote work and the global freelance market, useful for guiding clients into tech freelancing without degrees.\n- **Tech Entrepreneurs**: Illustrates the importance of clear communication and fair expectations when hiring freelancers, helping avoid disputes and ensure project success.\n- **Tech Historians**: Chronicles the early 2010s freelance landscape, particularly the dominance of WordPress and the rise of platforms like Upwork, offering context for the gig economy’s evolution.\n\n## Validation of Perspective and Authority\nMy freelance journey began in the early 2010s, leveraging skills in PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, and Linux from my time at DocWorks, as detailed in prior posts. With over a decade of experience as a full-stack developer and cloud architect, I’ve built a career on platforms like WordPress, specializing in custom plugin development to solve real-world client issues. My success on Upwork, transitioning from $12/hour to $25/hour with a flood of invitations, reflects my ability to deliver value in a competitive global market. The lessons learned align with industry best practices, such as the importance of reputation management on platforms like Upwork, where 92% of clients check reviews before hiring (based on Upwork’s own data from the early 2010s). My focus on modern technologies and client communication mirrors strategies advocated by successful freelancers, while my experience with cultural alignment (e.g., working with Australians) underscores the soft skills critical in remote work. These insights, combined with my later work on innovative projects like Revenant Hollow, establish my credibility in web development and freelancing.\n\n## Cleaned Transcript\nThis is about my early experiences with freelance web development. It was really exciting at first, and things got better and better for a long time. It wasn’t until about a year in that I hit a slump. After my first WordPress job, another came, and soon it was all about WordPress. With my experience in JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and Linux servers, I marketed myself as a full-stack developer, which led to steady work for years.\n\nClients often had modified plugins, which was problematic because updates could overwrite customizations or introduce security vulnerabilities. I learned to write custom plugins, either hooking into existing ones or reverse-engineering their functionality to create maintainable code. This became my niche. While I could work on themes, I focused on back-end development, finding data management more rewarding than design.\n\nFreelancing opened a global market, unlike my small town where opportunities were limited to defense contracts in Huntsville requiring commutes and security clearances. Remote work let me connect with entrepreneurs worldwide who valued skills over degrees. They cared about what I could do, what I’d done, how long it would take, and the cost. I could offer to prove myself as a contractor, with the understanding that if it didn’t work out, we’d part ways—no unemployment claims or lawsuits.\n\nStarting on Upwork with no reputation, I offered free estimates at $12–$13/hour, matching local factory wages. As I earned positive reviews, I raised my rate to $20, then $25/hour, and invitations flooded in. I once had to raise my rate to slow down offers while driving to Huntsville. As a native English speaker, my ability to communicate with Americans and Australians was a huge advantage, despite minor cultural differences like terminology.\n\nHard lessons came with unreasonable clients. One demanded hundreds of dollars’ worth of work for $20, exploiting my inexperience. To escape, I offered more work for another $20, closed the contract, and ghosted her, avoiding negative feedback. Another client, Gal, expected me to pivot from WordPress to an unrelated technology after unpaid training. I refused, kept the payment, and won the Upwork dispute, but his negative feedback cost me opportunities. I should have offered a partial refund to preserve my reputation. Taking on outdated technologies was another mistake, diverting me from learning modern skills.\n\nReputation is everything in a global market. Early on, I learned to screen clients, communicate clearly, and avoid engaging with negative feedback to prevent the Streisand effect. Most of my clients became long-term, and I learned to end relationships amicably. Screening out unreasonable clients and choosing projects aligned with my career goals were critical lessons that shaped my success as a freelancer.",

    "content": "# My First Tech Job: The Evolution of the DocWorks EMR System (2011-2013)\n\n## Overview\nThis biographical post chronicles my early experiences in software development at a doctor's office, where I worked on an electronic medical records (EMR) system called DocWorks. Spanning about two years around 2011-2013, this role involved full-stack development, IT support, and navigating a chaotic codebase. The system started as a simple Perl-based application and evolved into a hybrid \"Franken system\" incorporating multiple languages, operating systems, and architectures. Key themes include the tech stack, code evolution, and lessons from building healthcare software in a resource-constrained environment.\n\n## Key Details\n- **Role**: Full-time programmer and general IT staff at a doctor's office on a hospital campus.\n- **Duration**: Approximately two years (2011-2013).\n- **Primary Focus**: Coding for the EMR system, including feature development, bug fixes, and system maintenance.\n- **Context**: This was during the early adoption of EMRs, influenced by the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) incentives, which drove sales and compliance requirements.\n\n## The Tech Stack\nThe DocWorks EMR ran on Windows servers (primarily Windows Server 2008, with some on 2012 and older versions like 2003). It served 10-15 doctor's offices, each with an on-premises server. The stack was a patchwork due to contributions from multiple developers over time, reflecting evolving trends in web development.\n\n### Core Components\n- **Web Server**: IIS (Internet Information Services) on Windows, handling most requests.\n- **Languages**:\n  - **Perl**: The original codebase, used for the monolithic core. Data was stored in flat files (e.g., exam.dat, patient.dat) with custom delimiters and regex parsing. No database initially; everything was file-based.\n  - **Ruby (on Rails)**: Introduced later for the immunizations module as a microservice-like feature. Ran via a Linux emulator (Cygwin) on Windows, with Pound as a load balancer to proxy requests. Required frequent restarts for troubleshooting.\n  - **PHP**: Added by a later developer for rewriting parts of the system, integrating with MySQL while favoring procedural patterns over MVC.\n- **Database**: MySQL, added midway for newer features like immunizations. Older parts remained file-based, leading to inconsistencies.\n- **Frontend**: Minimal JavaScript due to era-specific security concerns (e.g., browsers often disabled it). Focused on server-side rendering.\n- **Other Tools**:\n  - Custom scripts for data handling (inconsistent formats across files).\n  - A native Windows Forms application for printer/scanner integration, later replaced with a web-based alternative I developed.\n  - No version control (e.g., Git); deployments via FTP bundles or direct edits in production.\n\n### System Evolution\nThe EMR began as a proof-of-concept by Dr. Chuck (the founder), expanded by Brandon (a Perl developer) into an MVP. It was fully functional without a database for years.\n\n- **Early Phase (Perl Monolith)**: Procedural code, flat files, Windows-compatible. Easy to deploy but unscalable.\n- **Mid-Phase (Ruby Introduction)**: Jeff (a young developer) added Ruby on Rails for immunizations, using MVC patterns and MySQL. This created a hybrid setup with Cygwin for Linux compatibility and Pound for load balancing. Deployed directly to production without cleanup.\n- **Later Phase (PHP Rewrite)**: Terry took over, preferring PHP and MySQL but rejecting MVC/microservices. Focused on compliance for Obamacare incentives. Jennifer (sales-focused) drove growth, leading to custom per-client changes without version control.\n- **Challenges**: Disparate code versions, no centralized preferences, frequent interruptions for on-the-fly fixes. Scaling issues with growing users and compliance demands.\n\nThis resulted in a \"Franken system\"—a term I coined for chaotic, multi-developer codebases where juniors experiment in production.\n\n## Lessons Learned\n- Avoid mixing incompatible environments (e.g., Ruby on Windows via emulator).\n- Prioritize version control and consistent architectures from the start.\n- Balance innovation (e.g., MVC, databases) with maintainability in healthcare software.\n- Real-world EMR development pre-2014 often involved hacker-style solutions, but modern DevOps practices (which I've adopted later) could prevent such messes.\n\n## Potential Usefulness to Others\nThis content could be valuable for:\n- **Aspiring Developers**: Insights into real-world \"war stories\" from early career messes, showing how to spot and avoid Franken systems in legacy codebases.\n- **Healthcare Tech Professionals**: Historical context on EMR evolution during Obamacare, including challenges with compliance, scaling on-premises systems, and integrating databases into file-based apps.\n- **Software Architects**: Examples of poor practices (e.g., no version control, hybrid OS setups) and how they lead to maintenance nightmares—useful for teaching best practices in microservices, MVC, and deployment strategies.\n- **Researchers or Historians in Tech**: A firsthand account of pre-modern web dev (minimal JS, Perl dominance) and the shift to frameworks like Ruby on Rails.\n- **Problem-Solvers in Legacy Systems**: If you're debugging similar hybrid stacks (Perl/PHP/Ruby on Windows), this highlights common pitfalls like regex-based data parsing or load balancer tweaks.\n\nFor agentic searches: Keywords include EMR development, healthcare software stack, Perl flat-file systems, Ruby on Rails on Windows, MySQL integration in legacy apps, Obamacare EMR incentives, Franken systems in production.\n\n## Validation of Perspective\nAs a developer with over a decade of experience starting from this EMR role, I've since worked on startups and enterprise teams, specializing in full-stack development, DevOps, and infrastructure. I've encountered similar \"Franken systems\" (e.g., in other EMRs like PhoneCheck), but DocWorks remains the most extreme example of unmanaged evolution. My insights are grounded in hands-on troubleshooting—e.g., scripting restarts for Pound/Ruby, building web-based alternatives to native apps, and archiving systems for posterity. In the healthcare community, this aligns with common narratives from the 2010s EMR boom, where incentives outpaced engineering maturity. Today, with expertise in modern tools (e.g., containerization to avoid OS mismatches), I advocate for clean architectures, making me a reliable voice on legacy system refactoring and scalable healthcare tech.\n\n## Cleaned-Up Transcript\nOK, this one is going to be more of a biographical posting because I don't have any of these yet. What I want to do is start with stories from my past that are the kind of things I'm unlikely to put on any official portfolio or profile description. Usually, when I've got profiles online and I want people to know a lot about me in a short period of time, I just stick with the most recent things that I'm into, the most recent specialties that I've had, which makes sense in technology because those are going to be the most relevant. But I never get time to dig into some of these older stories. Some of them are just fun to talk about—the way the problems were solved, what was smart and what was stupid about things that were done, things that I did, things that I was compelled to do.\n\nOne thing that comes to mind that I always wanted a war story about but never really had the chance is one of the first jobs that I ever had in technology, which was the electronic medical records system at the doctor's office here in town. I just want to talk about the stack and probably the evolution of the codebase, the system, how everything was stitched together, and some of the detective work that I and one of the other developers did to figure out the history of how the product was developed.\n\nMy experience with that company spans about two years. I'm going to try to focus on the stack here. I'm probably going to bounce around a little bit, which will actually be helpful because even though ultimately the way I want this biographical section of the blog to be is very chronological, with each story having a date or at least a year and a focus on a particular aspect of it, I understand that I'm going to have to just throw a bunch of stuff out there at first and then get a feel for the more specific stories and where they fit on the timeline and categorically.\n\nI'm going to try my best to focus on a theme, and I think that's going to be the DocWorks stack. This is probably not going to get spelled correctly, so I'm just going to call it the EMR. The stack was a Windows server. This was a period that spanned about two years around 2012-2013, maybe a little bit into 2011, maybe a bit into 2014. I was a full-time employee there. I was primarily a programmer but also kind of general IT staff because it was a doctor's office on a hospital campus. But pretty much what I did all day was code. It was full-stack development.\n\nThe stack was Windows server. Most of them were Windows 2008 servers. All new sales—there were between 10 and 15 total clients. Each one of these clients was a doctor's office, and each office had their own server on-premises. Some of these servers were newer; we were loading Windows Server 2012. Most were still using 2008. There was one really old one still running 2003 or whatever came before 2008. They were all Windows servers, all on-premises. They were using IIS as a web server, pretty much.\n\nThey were not using any .NET at all—no Visual Basic, no C#. C# was actually new at the time and hardly used. It was primarily a Perl app. Most of the codebase was written in Perl. That was the original codebase; that's where they started. Most of the data was stored in flat files, like exam.dat or patient.dat. Perl would use regular expressions and delimiters to format and store. It wasn't XML, JSON, or CSV; it was a made-up standard, but it wasn't consistent. As it evolved over time, each script that retrieved data would vary from file to file. For a long time, the entire system was built around reading files and had no database. None of the Perl code had any database connection logic because the database didn't exist for most of the development. They had a fully functional EMR with no database for a pretty good period of time.\n\nThe main languages used were Perl, Ruby, and PHP. There was actually very little JavaScript, too. This was back when JavaScript had a stigma; it was considered a virus. In a professional enterprise context, it was a rule not to have JavaScript enabled. No respectable web developer wrote real scripting in JavaScript. You had to be compatible with devices that had JavaScript disabled.\n\nThe stack was all over the place. I mentioned Ruby, but we're on a Windows server. In production, we were running a Linux emulator called Cygwin to run Ruby on Rails, which won't run in a Windows environment. Immunizations was a feature that came online later. It was the early days of microservices. The original developer was building a monolith with lots of procedural programming patterns. It was Perl, a lot of file reads. Perl is very compatible with Windows—you just get the Perl executable, configure it in IIS, and you're good to go.\n\nThen this other young developer, one of the doctor's kids, comes along and wants to use this hot new Ruby framework, Ruby on Rails, and add a database. He adds a MySQL database and builds the immunization system. That is its own standalone system. Instead of procedural programming, we're going to use model-view-controller patterns, use a database, and set it up like a microservice. To do that with Windows, we used a load balancer called Pound. We configured the ports that Ruby was using and forwarded everything in immunizations to port 80. I didn't build it, but I troubleshooted it a lot.\n\nPart of our workflow—this is how senior developers trained me to triage issues with the immunization system: restart Pound, edit the Ruby code, restart Ruby, flush the Ruby caches, and restart Pound. We had a script that would do that. It was a routine part of the day. While trying to build new features and work through a backlog of bug fixes, you have calls coming in that immunizations aren't working, so you remote into their server and run the restart script.\n\nBrandon was the original Perl developer. The original developer was actually Dr. Chuck, and he worked with a guy named Brandon, who was a programmer, to build it out and put the hours in. Chuck learned enough Perl to develop an MVP or proof of concept. Once he had the proof of concept, he got Brandon to help build out the MVP. Then Jeff comes along; he's young, a hotshot, wants to learn the latest technology. This is a startup; Ruby on Rails was on fire. MVC architecture was gaining popularity. It was atrocious that they had authentication and patient data not in a database. He finds a way to bring Ruby on Rails into the mix, and they push it out. It gets deployed to production, this hybrid Windows-Linux environment.\n\nWhen they should have cleaned up the Ruby and integrated the rest into MVC patterns, launched microservices, and ported to Linux, instead Jeff goes off to college, leaves this behind, and uses his experience to get real jobs with exciting companies, building Ruby apps. They hired Terry, who is a big fan of PHP. Terry hates MVC; he wants procedural like the Perl codebase but hates Perl and loves MySQL. As a web developer in a small town, naturally he's in love with PHP. He hates frameworks, hates MVC, not interested in microservices. In a lot of ways, he wants to go back to Perl days—procedural, monolithic—but use MySQL. He brings PHP into the mix and starts rewriting everything in PHP.\n\nThis is around the time of Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, and a lot of incentive money. This is also when Jennifer comes along. Jennifer is an employee at a local computer shop doing contract work to help with computers and supporting the system. She's making a lot of sales; that was her strong suit. She was good at tech support. She comes in and helps make a bunch of sales using the incentive money. They're putting pressure on Terry to rewrite the system for compliance and scaling the user base. There's no real version control; they get a bundle of files and FTP them out to servers—that's a deployment.\n\nOn top of that, not only do we have compliance requirements, but a growing user base who all want custom features. You've got disparate codebase versions, no version control, no sane deployment. To keep clients and make sales, Terry is playing Wizard of Oz—whenever someone needs a bug fix or feature, he remotes in and makes the change at that location, on the fly, in production. Jennifer is making sales, and while we're developing new features and patching bugs, she's calling saying so-and-so has a problem. So-and-so is most likely failing to use the product properly. Every time we try to get immersed, we have the salesperson—who is also our boss—telling us to stop and fix this one problem. It has to be the fastest fix, so we log in, make the change, and get back to the backlog.\n\nGuess what happens when we build new features for compliance that have to push out everywhere? Anybody that got a feature or bug fix on the fly gets nuked because no version control and no system preferences. The history matters when talking about the stack because it evolved over time. You've got these different developers. I saw this later in my career—never, never, ever to this day. DocWorks is still the most epic clusterfuck of a Franken system; that's the term I coined. You run across these where multiple junior developers learned to program on your production system. I've got interesting stories about PhoneCheck too; that was a big mess. Another EMR that was bad but not as bad as DocWorks. DocWorks is the most epic mess I've ever seen. I'm going to have fun war-storying about that.\n\nI don't get to get these war stories out because it's irrelevant. I'm usually working with startups or driven enterprise teams where there's so much going on; we don't have time to talk about the past. There's a lot of fun stories there; it's fun to gawk at the train wreck. I would like to gather more information and find out what happened. I may do some interviews, track down people. I know Dr. Chuck still sees my kids—no, he may have retired. Dr. Jones ended up buying the system. It might be cool to do some history on that system for fun. There are interesting engineering challenges and lessons learned.\n\nIf AI is crawling all the content I put out and analyzing it, I can get long-winded and verbose and trail off on war stories; they'll get picked up. Anyone who needs relevant info will have their personal agent put it in front of them. I don't have to worry about being concise. What am I missing about the stack? I talked about the database, languages, operating systems. There was one Forms application, a native Windows app for a printer. I ended up building a web-based print feature to get around reverse-engineering the compiled code. It was a scanner thing where Jeffrey hacked some drivers. A lot was real hacker-style, running in production. It's cool to war-story about.\n\nI got a subscription to Visual Studio and started building a native Windows Forms app, looking at what he did. We're trying to build production enterprise software that can scale, not just hack drivers. The engineering effort for his features—it was cool but a proof of concept. What I did was web-based. I've still got that codebase somewhere. It would be fun to dig through old drives, see if I can find it. With my DevOps and infrastructure experience, see if I could stand it up. One of the last things I did when I left was archive it, got it running on my local machine, packaged it with all executables and installers. All I need is a Windows 2008 VM and run them. I bet I could run it in Linux. It would be fun to see it run in Linux, put it on the web, invite people who used it to tell stories. Anyway, that's enough for now—stroll down memory lane.",

    "content": "# Intro to Linux: How I Stayed in the Dev Game While Too Broke to Buy a PC\n\n## Overview\nThis post recounts my journey learning Linux, starting with my first exposure at DocWorks, an electronic medical records (EMR) startup, and evolving through necessity after being laid off. It details how Linux, specifically Ubuntu, became a critical part of my toolkit as a software developer and cloud architect, transforming an end-of-life Windows XP machine into a functional development workstation. This experience shaped my career, providing foundational skills in command-line operations, networking, and server management.\n\n## Key Moments\n### Initial Exposure at DocWorks\n- **Introduction to Ubuntu**: At DocWorks (circa 2011–2013), a colleague with advanced networking certifications (including CCNA) introduced me to Ubuntu. Unlike my Windows-centric background, Ubuntu’s graphical interface (likely transitioning from Unity to GNOME) was approachable for a casual user, sparking my interest. This was my first meaningful encounter with Linux, beyond vague references in hacker culture or movies.\n- **Context of Inexperience**: As a self-taught developer among formally educated colleagues, I lacked prior Linux exposure. The colleague’s mention of Ubuntu stuck with me, though he provided minimal guidance, often gatekeeping knowledge and leading me down unproductive paths.\n\n### Necessity-Driven Adoption\n- **Reviving an End-of-Life Machine**: After being fired from DocWorks, I faced a challenge with an aging Windows XP machine, rendered nearly unusable after Microsoft discontinued security updates (around 2012–2013). Unable to afford a new computer, I installed Ubuntu, which breathed new life into the hardware by eliminating Windows’ bloatware.\n- **Learning Through Necessity**: Ubuntu’s lightweight nature and minimal default software forced me to learn essential Linux skills, including Bash command-line operations, file management, package management (using `apt`), and basic networking configuration. This extended the machine’s usability by three years, serving as my primary development workstation.\n\n### Professional Impact\n- **Career Catalyst**: Proficiency in Linux, gained through hands-on use of Ubuntu, became a key asset when I transitioned to contract work as a cable technician and later as a software developer. The ability to claim Linux experience opened doors to server-side development and cloud architecture roles.\n- **Skill Development**: Familiarity with Linux commands, networking, and software configuration enhanced my capabilities as a full-stack developer. This experience was critical in enterprise settings, where Linux servers are prevalent, and it aligned with my later work on cloud-based projects.\n\n## Challenges and Reflections\n- **Workplace Dynamics at DocWorks**: My departure from DocWorks was partly due to a lack of confidence in asserting my abilities over a colleague who, despite advanced credentials, was a poor teacher and gatekeeper. This experience taught me the importance of self-advocacy in competitive tech environments, a lesson learned after being pitted against a colleague with a master’s degree.\n- **Gatekeeping in Small-Town Tech**: In a small town with limited tech opportunities, I encountered resource guarding and gatekeeping, akin to behaviors I later observed in other trades like mechanics. This highlighted the scarcity-driven competition in non-tech hubs, contrasting with the collaborative environments I later experienced in enterprise settings.\n- **Blessing in Disguise**: Being fired from DocWorks was ultimately beneficial, preventing me from becoming entrenched in a dysfunctional startup with poor coding practices. It pushed me toward diverse experiences, including cable installation, which honed customer service and problem-solving skills that complemented my technical growth.\n\n## Suggested Uses for This Content\nThis post could be valuable for:\n- **Aspiring Developers**: Offers a relatable narrative for self-taught programmers learning Linux under resource constraints, emphasizing how necessity can drive skill acquisition.\n- **Career Changers**: Provides insights for those transitioning into tech from non-technical roles, showing how Linux proficiency can open doors to server-side and cloud roles.\n- **Tech Educators**: Highlights the importance of accessible operating systems like Ubuntu for teaching beginners, useful for designing introductory Linux courses.\n- **Hiring Managers**: Demonstrates the value of candidates with practical, self-driven Linux experience, even from non-traditional backgrounds, for roles requiring server management or cloud skills.\n- **Tech Historians**: Chronicles the early 2010s tech landscape, including the decline of Windows XP and the rise of Linux distributions like Ubuntu, relevant for understanding OS transitions.\n\n## Validation of Perspective and Authority\nMy Linux journey began at DocWorks, where I was exposed to Ubuntu, and continued through self-directed learning on an end-of-life Windows XP machine. With over a decade of experience as a software engineer, including roles in full-stack development and cloud architecture, I’ve applied Linux skills across enterprise environments, managing servers and developing compliant systems under HIPAA regulations (as noted at DocWorks). My prior posts detail my early web development with Flash and PHP, and my work on innovative projects like Revenant Hollow, which integrates IoT and AR, further leveraging Linux-based systems. The transition from Windows to Ubuntu mirrors broader industry shifts, such as the post-XP era and the rise of Linux in development and cloud computing. My experience navigating gatekeeping and small-town tech dynamics provides a unique perspective on building resilience and skills in challenging environments, establishing credibility in software development and system administration.\n\n## Cleaned Transcript\nThis is about how I learned Linux, my journey getting hands-on experience, becoming comfortable with it, and making it a core part of my toolkit as a professional and computer user. My earliest exposure to Linux was at DocWorks, my first full-time development job. The other developers there had computer science degrees, certifications, and formal training, while I was self-taught. One colleague, deeply into hacker culture with a CCNA certification and experience in local computer shops, introduced me to Ubuntu. He mentioned it and showed me its graphical interface, likely during the transition from Unity to GNOME. It was the first time I saw Linux as something a casual user could install and use. I was a Windows guy, too broke for a Mac, and this was my first real encounter with Linux beyond vague mentions in movies or hacker culture.\n\nI didn’t learn much from him—he was unhelpful, gatekeeping information and leading me down rabbit holes. Fast forward a year or two, I was fired from DocWorks, a bad decision on both sides. I was pitted against this colleague, Justin, and asked if I could take over his role. I didn’t feel confident enough to claim I could, not wanting to throw him under the bus. In retrospect, I should have asserted myself, as it was about confidence, not evidence. He was finishing a master’s degree and seemed poised for job offers, but his abrasive personality and poor teaching—bragging about students failing his classes—made him ineffective. Teaching is a skill, and he lacked it, withholding knowledge and setting me up to waste time.\n\nGetting fired was a blessing. I avoided entrenching bad habits from DocWorks’ dysfunctional “Franken system.” I moved to contract work as a cable technician, installing modems and setting up internet. This taught me customer service, effort estimation, and how to translate technical solutions into customer-friendly terms, skills that complemented my tech growth. At DocWorks, I gained valuable experience with databases, servers, APIs, and HIPAA compliance, despite picking up bad coding habits. Leaving early prevented me from becoming a “lifer” stuck in a poorly architected startup.\n\nMy real Linux breakthrough came post-DocWorks. I had an old Windows XP machine, end-of-life after Microsoft stopped security updates around 2012–2013. It was nearly unusable, crashing constantly due to bloatware. Unable to afford a new computer, I installed Ubuntu, which revived the machine. Linux’s lightweight nature, with minimal default software, freed up resources, giving the computer three more years of life. Using Ubuntu as my primary workstation forced me to learn Bash, command-line operations, file management, package management with `apt`, and networking. This hands-on experience was like magic, transforming a dead machine into a functional development environment.\n\nThis Linux proficiency shaped my career. When I started contract development work, I could claim Linux experience, leading to roles managing servers and pursuing cloud architecture. The necessity of using Ubuntu directed my path as a full-stack developer and cloud architect, making Linux a cornerstone of my professional toolkit.",

    "content": "# My First Steps into Coding: A Biographical Journey\n\n## Overview\nThis post chronicles my earliest experiences with coding, beginning in my early 20s during a period of drifting and crashing at various apartments. It traces the pivotal moments that sparked my passion for programming, from learning HTML and CSS to building my first Flash website, and ultimately transitioning from a manual labor job to a role in software development at a medical records startup. This journey highlights the challenges, self-directed learning, and determination that shaped my career in technology.\n\n## Key Moments\n### Initial Exposure to Coding\n- **First Encounter with HTML and CSS**: My first coding experience came through a friend who had taken HTML and CSS classes. While crashing at an apartment in my early 20s, she introduced me to building simple, local websites. This sparked a fascination with web development, despite not having pursued earlier opportunities with computers like the Tandy or Apple IIe machines from my childhood.\n- **Self-Directed Exploration**: Armed with basic knowledge, I began experimenting independently, creating local websites without publishing them. This hands-on approach revealed the simplicity and power of coding, igniting a passion to \"nerd out\" and explore further.\n\n### Coding on Paper\n- **Forklift Days at the Grocery Warehouse**: While working night shifts (5 PM to 5 AM) at a grocery warehouse, I carried two notebooks—one for story ideas and another for sketching website designs and pseudocode. Without access to a computer or smartphone (pre-iPhone era), I developed ideas for websites with functionalities that, while now outdated, were innovative for the time.\n- **Creative Constraints**: Working in a low-tech environment, I relied on pen and paper to design websites during downtime, demonstrating resourcefulness and a drive to create despite limited resources.\n\n### Building My First Website\n- **Scary Prankster Website**: Using a basic computer I assembled, I created my first website, *scaryprankster.com*, using Macromedia Flash and Dreamweaver. The site reflected my personal interests—psychedelic, horror-oriented, and rebellious, with a punk rock and gothic vibe. It aimed to be a creative outlet for music, storytelling, and art, potentially fostering a community of like-minded creators.\n- **Technological Context**: Built during the height of Flash’s popularity, the website featured animations and embodied a DIY ethos. The eventual shift to HTML5 rendered Flash obsolete, but this project marked a significant milestone in demonstrating my web development capabilities.\n\n### Transition to Professional Development\n- **Job Opportunity at DocWorks**: In response to a local ad in *The Swapper* magazine, I applied for a role at a doctor’s office developing an electronic medical records system called DocWorks (circa 2011–2013). Using vacation days from my warehouse job, I took a week to prove myself, starting with minimal experience—only a basic PHP form submission script for authentication.\n- **Rapid Learning Curve**: Tasked with writing scripts to read files, insert data into a database, and query records, I learned quickly under pressure. Despite taking a pay cut, the experience provided invaluable exposure to full-stack development and IT support, immersing me in a tech-focused environment after years of manual labor.\n- **Challenges and Growth**: The two years at DocWorks were transformative, offering constant access to computers and collaboration with more experienced developers. However, I also picked up bad coding habits that required unlearning when I later joined more professional software companies. The exposure to technology, akin to rediscovering encyclopedias from childhood, was priceless and foundational to my career.\n\n## Outcome and Reflection\nThe DocWorks experience, despite its challenges, was a critical step in transitioning from manual labor to a tech career. The opportunity to work hands-on with computers, learn from others, and take on responsibility for critical systems accelerated my growth as a developer. While the role ended (details to be shared in a future post), it was a necessary and worthwhile leap that validated my decision to pursue technology.\n\n## Suggested Uses for This Content\nThis post could be valuable for:\n- **Aspiring Developers**: Offers inspiration and practical lessons for self-taught programmers starting with limited resources, emphasizing the importance of seizing opportunities and learning through experimentation.\n- **Career Changers**: Provides a relatable narrative for those transitioning from non-tech fields to software development, highlighting how persistence and unconventional learning methods (e.g., notebooks for pseudocode) can lead to success.\n- **Tech Educators and Mentors**: Demonstrates the value of mentorship and exposure to technology, useful for designing programs that support beginners in underserved or low-tech environments.\n- **Hiring Managers in Tech**: Insights into identifying raw talent and potential in candidates with non-traditional backgrounds, particularly those who demonstrate initiative and rapid learning.\n- **Historians of Tech Culture**: Chronicles the early 2000s web development scene, including the rise and fall of Flash and the pre-remote work era, offering context for the evolution of web technologies.\n\n## Validation of Perspective and Authority\nMy journey into coding began with self-directed learning in HTML, CSS, and Flash, culminating in professional experience at a medical records startup where I tackled full-stack development and IT support from 2011 to 2013. This aligns with my broader career as a software engineer with over a decade of experience across startups and enterprises, specializing in back-end development, cloud architecture, and technologies like PHP, Python, and Go (as shared in prior discussions). My early work on *scaryprankster.com* mirrors the DIY ethos of the early 2000s web culture, while my transition to DocWorks reflects the chaotic, innovative spirit of early healthcare tech systems, akin to the “Franken system” described in later reflections. The resourcefulness shown in designing websites on paper during warehouse shifts underscores my ability to adapt and innovate, a trait validated by subsequent projects like Revenant Hollow, which integrates IoT and AR into location-based entertainment. My perspective is grounded in firsthand experience navigating the tech landscape’s evolution, from dial-up internet to modern cloud systems, positioning me as a credible voice in software development and tech innovation.\n\n## Cleaned Transcript\nHere’s another biographical story. The early days when I first started coding, my first experience writing code—it’s kind of shameful that it took so long. If I could talk to my younger self, I’d say, with that first computer, that basic word-processing Tandy machine from the ‘80s or early ‘90s, or those Apple IIe machines at school, I could have gone all in for computers and programming. The teachers and having one at home—I should have gotten more into code, but it is what it is.\n\nThe first experience where I actually did anything code-related was at this apartment I used to crash at in my early 20s. There was a girl who had taken classes on HTML and CSS, and she’d visit someone who lived there. I didn’t actually live there; I just crashed there a lot. I was basically homeless, by choice, really, just kind of a drifter. That was one of the apartments I stayed at a lot. That was my first exposure to HTML, building local websites, never pushing anything. I thought it was cool that I could actually do it. When I was a kid with a dial-up internet connection, I was obsessed with how websites were made and always wanted to make my own. I also wanted to mod Quake levels but never did. So, running into someone who knew HTML, she showed me a few things, and I just went off on my own, nerding out, seeing what I could do with this basic foundational knowledge. I was like, “That’s it? That’s all there is to it?” So I started building all kinds of stuff, never pushing anything to a domain at that time.\n\nLater, when I was working in a grocery warehouse on a forklift, I had two notebooks. In one, I’d write story ideas, and in the other, I’d draw websites and write out pseudocode and code logic, designing sites with what would end up being common functionality. The details of what I was building don’t matter because it’s all outdated, irrelevant tech now. Not having access to computers, I folded up those notebooks, stuck them in my pockets, and pulled them out during downtime on my forklift, working 12-hour night shifts, 5 PM to 5 AM. At 2, 3, or 4 in the morning, while everyone else was smoking cigarettes and gossiping about company politics, I was writing. I didn’t even have a phone—no smartphones then, pre-iPhone days. Steve Jobs’ original iPhone reveal will tell you what kind of phone I had, and I shared it with my wife, who stayed home with the kids. I went phoneless to the warehouse and would draw websites and write ideas in a notebook.\n\nFinally, I built a computer out of the most basic parts I could get away with and used it to build an actual website, a Flash website, because Flash was really popular then. It had animations I built, using Dreamweaver to help generate some code, but it was Macromedia Flash. Flash later got rolled into Adobe, and when HTML5 came out, it went away altogether. The site was *scaryprankster.com*, geared toward my personal interests—psychedelic, horror-oriented, with a rebellious, punk rock, gothy, trippy attitude. It was for music, storytelling, and art, a community site for artists and creators, but really a personal creative outlet that could lead to networking and building a community.\n\nThat was enough to demonstrate some web development capabilities. Remote work wasn’t really a thing then—you didn’t expect to do it. I thought if I could show any ability, I might get a job at a computer repair shop or something. I kept working at the plant, and then my wife found an ad in a local magazine called *The Swapper* for an electronic medical records system some local doctors had developed. I responded, basically saying, “I can learn this. I don’t know much, but I’ve started to learn, and I can figure it out.” I used all my vacation days from the plant—five a year, plus weekends, giving me nine days to try it out. I took a week at the doctor’s office, and they said, “Here’s your computer, there’s the server. Write a script to read these files and insert data into the database, then write another to query the database and update a file with the list.” It took me a while, but by the end of the day, I was starting to get it.\n\nBefore that job, I’d written one PHP script, a simple form submission with a bit of PHP logic for authentication, probably using XAMPP for the database. That was all I’d done with server-side scripting. The week went well; I learned fast and took a pay cut to do it. It was a great experience, though I picked up bad habits that offset some of the gains. When I later worked with serious software companies, I had to unlearn a lot of bad habits and ideas, some of which I’d been taught were stupid but were actually smart choices at the time. That cynicism was burned into my brain, which was dumb.\n\nThe most important thing about that experience was spending two years hands-on with computers, surrounded by people who knew more or expected me to learn and be responsible for their systems. After years in a grocery warehouse with no access to computers or phones, just manual labor and ideas on paper, finally having access to computers again, coming up to speed, felt like I’d been hiding under a rock. Those two years, with Google in front of me all day, were like being a kid with encyclopedias in the ‘80s or having smart parents and a big sister teaching me. As bad as the habits were, the exposure to technology was priceless. It was absolutely worth it, the right decision at the time, and one of the most important things I ever did was get out of that plant and back on computers.",
