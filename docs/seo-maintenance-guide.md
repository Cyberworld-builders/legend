# SEO Maintenance Guide

## Overview

This document provides instructions for maintaining and updating the SEO features implemented in this branch. As your blog grows and evolves, these features will need periodic updates to remain effective and accurate.

## üîÑ Periodic Maintenance Tasks

### 1. Topic Clusters & Related Posts Analysis

**When to Update:** Every time you add a new blog post

**What Needs Updating:**
- Topic categorization logic in `components/TopicClusters.tsx`
- Related posts matching algorithm in `components/RelatedPosts.tsx`
- Internal linking keywords in `lib/content-utils.ts`

**How to Update:**

#### Topic Clusters (`components/TopicClusters.tsx`)
```typescript
const getPostTopics = (slug: string): string[] => {
  // Add new topic categories as your content grows
  if (slug.includes('ai') || slug.includes('agentic') || slug.includes('automation') || slug.includes('bot')) return ['AI & Automation'];
  if (slug.includes('career') || slug.includes('job') || slug.includes('validation') || slug.includes('framework') || slug.includes('founder') || slug.includes('engineer')) return ['Career & Professional Development'];
  if (slug.includes('development') || slug.includes('tech') || slug.includes('n8n') || slug.includes('supabase') || slug.includes('vapi') || slug.includes('lovable') || slug.includes('rendercom') || slug.includes('replit')) return ['Development & Tools'];
  if (slug.includes('marketing') || slug.includes('sales') || slug.includes('web-presence')) return ['Marketing & Business'];
  
  // ADD NEW TOPICS HERE:
  // if (slug.includes('new-topic-keyword')) return ['New Topic Category'];
  
  return ['General'];
};
```

#### Related Posts (`components/RelatedPosts.tsx`)
- Update the same `getPostTopics` function
- Consider adding more sophisticated topic matching based on content analysis
- Review and adjust the scoring algorithm for better relevance

#### Internal Linking (`lib/content-utils.ts`)
```typescript
const keywordToSlugMap: { [key: string]: string } = {
  // Existing mappings...
  
  // ADD NEW KEYWORDS FOR NEW POSTS:
  // 'New Technology': 'new-post-slug',
  // 'New Framework': 'another-post-slug',
};
```

**Automation Ideas:**
- Consider implementing a content analysis script that automatically categorizes posts
- Use NLP libraries to extract topics from post content
- Create a dashboard to visualize topic distribution

### 2. Author Schema Updates

**When to Update:** 
- When you gain new skills or technologies
- When you add new social media accounts
- When you complete new projects or certifications
- Quarterly reviews

**What Needs Updating:**
- `components/AuthorSchema.tsx` - Professional information
- `app/layout.tsx` - Organization schema

**How to Update:**

#### Author Schema (`components/AuthorSchema.tsx`)
```typescript
export default function AuthorSchema({ 
  name = "Jay Long",
  url = "https://cyberworldbuilders.com",
  email = "contact@cyberworldbuilders.com",
  jobTitle = "Software Engineer & Founder", // UPDATE TITLE
  description = "Professional software engineer specializing in web development, AWS solutions, and SaaS development." // UPDATE DESCRIPTION
}: AuthorSchemaProps) {
  const personSchema = {
    // ... existing schema ...
    "knowsAbout": [
      "Software Engineering",

    ],
    "sameAs": [
      "https://github.com/CyberWorld-builders",
      "https://youtube.com/@cyberbuilders", 
      "https://x.com/cyberbuilders",
      "https://www.facebook.com/cyberworldbuilders",
      "https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/jaylongcyberworld",
      // ADD NEW SOCIAL ACCOUNTS HERE:

    ],
  };
}
```

#### Organization Schema (`app/layout.tsx`)
