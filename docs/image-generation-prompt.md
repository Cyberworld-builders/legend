## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Square Images (1024x1024)
**Problem**: AI generates square images instead of 16:9 ratio
**Solution**: Emphasize "EXACTLY 1200x630 pixels" and "16:9 aspect ratio" multiple times in the prompt

### Issue: Wrong Color Palette
**Problem**: Images don't match the cyberpunk aesthetic
**Solution**: Be specific about colors: "Dark background with bright green (#00ff00) highlights"

### Issue: Generic Content
**Problem**: Images don't relate to the article topic
**Solution**: Add specific article elements and technology concepts

### Issue: Poor Quality
**Problem**: Images are blurry or low resolution
**Solution**: Specify "High-quality digital illustration" and "professional" in the prompt
